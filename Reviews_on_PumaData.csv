I wear a women's size 7, so I ordered a men's size 5.5 and they fit perfectly.  Super comfortable.  I searched high and low for a nice pair of shoes in the color and style I liked, and I wasn't finding anything in the women's department. Very, very difficult to find a men's 5.5, and then if you do, to find one in stock.  Always loved Pumas and going to continue buying them because these are very nicely made.  The craftsmanship is just quality, with no imperfections or cheap-looking junk on them.  Also, why are all the shoes on Amazon, or excuse me, 99% of the shoes on Amazon, currently unavailable? Thank you, Puma for actually having the shoes that you advertise available for purchase.  That is, after all, the point.  I needed them asap for work, and they showed up in less than 2 days.  Perfect colors for my job requirements.  Nice to be able to buy some work shoes that I actually would wear even when not at work instead of having to buy some nasty embarrassing shoes that make me feel like some sort of matronly dweeb and not in a good way. These shoes are sick.

The toe area is extremely narrow/tight and these seem to be sized a little too small. I have had 5 pairs of Puma shoes and they are all really well made (I still have all of them) but these are for some reason just a little tighter than usual. I am returning for a half size up from my usual Puma size. I bought the black on black with brown soles.

I have ordered a size 7 shoe in all my puma shoes . I Ordered this gorgeous shoe in a 7. I received a 7 but it's at least half an inch longer than my previous size 7 pumas.

Second pair of these vs the original suedes. Love them. Only concern and knew this buy the second pair was the toe box being narrow.  After wearing several times they have broken in nicely. I did add the white shoes laces to both the black and blue pair to give a nice contrast. Love the shoes.

This tennis shoe is nice looking neat appearance. I have several pairs of puma classic suede tennis shoes that is one reason i knew about how they might fit which is good.One thing people might need to be made clear of is that this tennis shoe is leather suede upper the tongue of the shoe is material sole is rubber and the body is suede leather based on the labeling and my observation. The reason i bring this up is that the description on line says 100% synthectic thats a selling point the body of the shoe is real leather suede. Hop this helps. I would buy again if needed good price too.

The product came in packaged in the puma box. Brand new (not returned and then redistributed). The shoe looks great and the suede is nice. They spot a little if your caught out in the rain. The tow box is a little more narrow than I’m used to. Arch is ok. Over all they are a little tight. They are the correct size me.  One size up would be too big and one size down would’ve been tight and I would have returned them.  My suggestion, if you have a wide foot, this is really not for you. This is not their fault but had the toe box been a little wider, they would have gotten 5 stars.

Got these for my son, Richard Toucher, he says they are  comfortable and stylish and wonderful shoes to skate in! He landed his first McTwist in them and immediately was asked out by a girl to take the V card.

Nice, well constructed pretty comfortable overall, look good, but narrower and thereore tighter in the toe area than a 9.5 should be IMO.  It is almost as is the sizing is off.  Overall satisfied with the buy however.  Puma products I have purchased in the past fit better out of the box--the size you bought was the size you got. I would give it a 4.5 if I could FWIW.

Black Pumas With a brown sole are a bit rare. Sneaker heads know! I got these in 3 days!! NICE I've got this shoe in every color I can find. Do yourself a favor get 2 pair the black with white sole is sharp looking as well. I ride my HARLEY in these, work, workout you name it Puma is for the ""Big Cats"" If that's you...This your shoe. Or if your not impressed the return policy is top notch. No im not a paid spokesperson I give straight up reviews if its crap I make it more than known. If its quality as in this case ill let you know? Still can't believe they had the brown sole? AWESOME!!

Great looking sneaker.  That's the positive.  The negative, reality, is that this sneaker is, by far, the tightest, harshest fit across the top of my foot of any sneaker that I have purchased in the past 45 years.  After 20 minutes of wearing these Puma sneakers on an airplane flight, for example, I had to take them off just to get circulation back.  No exaggeration.  Same when I'm sitting in a chair in my office.Size 13 (my normal sneaker) with a thin sock.  I'm 6'2, 210 lbs, athletic build, medium foot width.  For now, I'm stuck with these because I foolishly tossed the Puma box - - cannot return these Puma sneakers or I would do so in a NY minute.  I've loosened up the laces, which gives these Puma sneakers a goofy, odd look aesthetically.  These Puma sneakers are going to the Salvation Army bin.

The left shoe is great but the right shoe has an uneven flooring and smashes the right toes. I wore for an hour+ and was in unbelievable pain despite sitting most of the time. I’ll give to Goodwill and seek another brand. (The similar Pumas I bought years ago were very comfortable. Sigh.)

I stand on my feet all day anywhere from 8-12hrs a day in a warehouse so comfortable shoes are a must and these fit the bill. Good for walking/exercising too.

These shoes are not suede like I thought but some cotton/polyester blend which is ok. If  you have feet that are a little wide or a lot these are not the shoes for you. They are narrow in the toe and tight fitting. They look awesome on the shelf.

these shoes look cool.  they are like walking on the ground barefoot though, like paper thin bottoms.  Also, they seem to be narrow, but after wearing a day or so at work they stretched a little.  My advice is to wear these only when you do not plan on doing any extensive walking because they have no support or comfort.  But they do look good.

I ordered the blue sneakers and while they look good, they are definitely a cheaper version of the classic and they are 100% NOT suede, hence -2 stars. I have a black pair from a couple years back and those are absolutely Suede and considerably more comfortable. These are a synthetic copy of the original. I don't know why the description indicates these are suede. If you look at the pictures of the blue, the 1st picture is what you will receive. You will notice in the other pictures, the shoes ARE suede as you can see the difference in the amount of furryness (lol) which is what they would look like if they were legit suede.

I love these Pumas! This is probably my 7 pair in 10 years. Its the only shoe I wear day in and day out. I live in NYC and walk everywhere. Unless it’s snowing or raining hard, this is the shoe I wear. Comfortable, supportive, stylish and reasonably priced.When I start to feel the insoles wearing  down, I get a pair of the Superfeet insoles and I get more mileage from the sneakers. The sneaker itself never rips or falls apart.The only reason I get a brand new pair is because sole gets some wear and tear. Totally normal for the amount of walking I do and the hell I put them through.

I finally decided to give Puma a chance. I have been wearing skate shoes for years. Then I went back and forth between New balance and adidas. I wear a size 12 in every shoe I have owned. The Puma size 12 runs so abnormally small my feet hurt after wearing them. they fit but the moment you walk in then they start to pinch in weird places. I never wore a wide shoe I'd be willing to give it a try but the Puma fit just feels awkward.

I'm a regular size guy, who wears a regular size 10...not a wide, not a slim, but a regular size 10 like you find anywhere you look.  But these aren't those shoes.  These are made for small, thin feet, probably not unlike the person who made them.  One supposes the foot blanks used to size these shoes are modeled on thinner framed feet.  It's not that the leather won't eventually stretch (the one's I got are suede).  it's that the rubber sole is about 3/16ths of an inch too narrow, so I can feel the edges of my feet in the toe box resting on the rubber outsole walls.  I wore them for a few weeks to see if they would break in, but all that did is make things more pronounced.  As the insole molded to my foot, I could feel the outsole walls more and more.Great shoes if you have feet like skis and normally find shoes are too wide in the toe box.

I bought these in my size and tried to wear them just as anyone would.  They were far too tight and after a very short period of time I had to put on a different pair of sneakers.  I placed shoe stretchers into them and attempted to stretch them out a bit.  Even after a week with the stretchers still in place the sneakers were too uncomfortable to wear.I'm very sorry I ordered these and will probably just donate them or worse throw them out.Waste of my money and won't purchase this brand again.

I had a pair of these when I was a kid and they were probably some of the most comfortable shoes I ever had.  I bought them out of nostalgia and was not disappointed when they arrived and I put them on!  It was like running into an old friend after not seeing each other for years.  Love them so much I ordered a pair and had them delivered to my best friend who used to loot my closet when we were kids.  It wasn't unusual for me to show up at school and spot him coming down the hall totally decked out in clothes that all belonged to me and which I had no idea were even missing from my closet.  His review was very similar to mine.  Highly recommended and will continue purchasing these until I am too old and crippled to rock sneakers any more!

This is my first pair of Pumas that I have bought in a very long time, I usually buy Adidas or Nike shoes.  The look of the shoe is clean and classic looking, with the slate blue Puma stripe complimenting the darker blue of the rest of the shoe.  Having said that, the fit of the shoe (especially in the toe box) is really tight starting from the middle of the shoe.  I am hoping that the shoes will expand a little after breaking them in.

I know Puma runs small,  ordered a size up and still a bit narrow,  but they'll probably break in OK.  Took almost two weeks to get here WITH prime and showed up WITHOUT A SHOEBOX. I purchased new sneakers and either the seller or Amazon is passing a returned item off as new.  I'm not a collector but I do like  to keep them in box so I know what to grab.

6’2, 200 lb Male Athlete.  Cool Shoe,  Goes awesome with white, grey, tan, light blue, and of course black jeans/pants. Super casual and comfy. Go with your normal size. Mine is a 11.5 and I decided to go with 11 and they are a bit snug around the width of the fore foot. Going w/ my regular size would have been better. With casual shoes, I like to keep the laces loose.

They look normal in smaller sizes, my wife likes her pair, but once you get to mens sizes they look wedge shape and pointed. They are incredibly tight in the toe box and relatively loose at the heel.

I love this sneaker. Fits great even though this style of footwear usually hurts my big toes because usually they are  narrow and my feet are wide. Somehow they look the same as similar sneakers but fit better than any other. Style is great and I also have them in navy / white and I had to get a black / white one without the swoosh being white and this one was perfect. Even the gold Puma logo fits better with black than any other color. Simply awesome shoes, very very comfortable with their memory foam type insole and they look great!

I've always liked Puma Suede Classics. The price is great. The quality is great. They're comfortable for me. The sizing is a little off. You might have to go a half size larger or even one full size larger. Either way, you won't be disappointed though.

Idk why anyone would rate these negatively. I paid $19.99 for some pumas!!!?. Hands down best deal I’ve ever gotten on a pair of shoes! The product is quality and fit as intended. I mean if you’re thinking these are like  sports shoes then you’re mistaken. They are meant for everyday use with like going out, school, or work. If you’re looking for sports shoes then you definitely want to go the nike or adidas route.

This is the first pair of shoes I felt compelled to return. These shoes are extremely narrow. I wore the shoes for all but 2 minutes and after I took them off, the middle of my foot felt extremely constricted. If you have even slightly wide feet, you should steer clear of this shoe.
"

I wanted to echo what other have said. The heel area of the internal sole disintegrated after a few weeks of casual wearing. I had to replace them with Dr. Schol's. Who know how long they will last. I will likely have to replace the pair of shoes entirely. Poor design, they don't last.

Like the title says. I don't usually wear socks, so breaking in new shoes can be a pain. These are already breaking in fairly painlessly, and for the money and being able to get it in size 14, I really cannot complain. Just a good all-around walking shoe, albeit one without a mountain of arch support (so if you need a fairly sizeable lump under your arch, look elsewhere).
"
175,"
I bought these shoes for work (restaurant) and they are great, but they run very tight. I bought a 9 originally (I’ve bought 9 for Puma before) but I had to re-order a 9.5 instead. They’re light and flat, which is why I like them since I’m on my feet 8hrs a day, 5 days a week. Definitely a good buy with the right size.

I purchased this pair just before X-mas, thinking they would be a brand new pair of shoes to gift.

Very disappointed from a brand like Puma, they didn’t even care to change the shoes’ box.

Just got these and wearing for the first time today . Left one is pinching my little toe so I may need to wear them some and break them in ? Hopefully I won't need to return them. I enjoy them and don't want to return but if they keep up with the pinching I will.

Not a vey comfortable shoe.  Very little in the way of cushion and zero arch support.  Removed the insole and replaced with thicker one, made some difference but wouldn't recommend for anything other than casual (non-athletic) use.  Tends to wear on the warm/hot side.

Took 7 days to get here and was undersized. Replacement was going to take 7 weeks! Getting a refund. Size 11 is not size 11. Order a 12.I liked them so much I bought a pair directly from Puma. Still breaking them in as they make my feat ache after a few hours.

So, apparently shoemakers have juggled their sizing criteria.  In the last six months, I have had to return every pair of shoes or boots that I have ordered online and get one size larger.  Oddly, I have worn the same size shoe since high school, and shoes bought two years ago in that size fit fine.  Seems to me that someone is cutting corners to save a few bucks.  Maybe I should stop buying online and make my lazy self actually go to a real store.

Pumas have always been too narrow in the toe box for me, but I don't care for 'dad sneakers"" so I tried again. These fit well and are cushy. The suede is warmer than canvas and stretches a bit too conform to your foot. They have a foam footbed similar to the Adidas cloudfoam, so good for standing on concrete all day. I can't attest to the durability yet, and I wouldn't wear them in foul weather, but they are stylie and a good bargain.

I have bought pumas almost exclusively for the last 20+ years. I buy about 2 piars, black and blue, and wear them for about a year. The old pairs go to outdoor work shoes and the new ones for work. I bought these in May but really started wearing them in September. Just saw this rip on the side yesterday and I don't remember hitting anything shape that could have ripped it. Honestly this is a first for this happening. Super disappointed hope this isn't a sigh of quality issues and more of the same in the future.

Came really clean, being delivered I was worried they'd have scuffs but the shoe was perfect that way. I've always worn 10.5US so I didn't hesitate to order that size, however with these shoes they are a bit narrow for my feet (I have wider feet). I've never owned a pair of Pumas before so not sure if this is normal for the brand. All around a nice and comfy shoe still and I will be able to wear regularly once broke in a bit.

Updated review:I've never worn out a set of shoes so quickly.  The first few months they were pretty good / comfortable, but quickly the foam / sole sort of just thinned out.  After about 5 months I wore completely through the sole, and cracks developed that would allow water to go through the sole.  Plus they became very uncomfortable.  I really treated these shoes with kid gloves.  Typically I ruin shoes due to hiking in them, biking, and running.  I only walked around in these as I have other specific shoes for those activities (not always the case in my younger years).Also, even when brand new these shoes could not keep water out.  The upper portion of the shoe will wick water quickly.  Even on just wet streets (not puddles) your feet get soaked.  I have since bought a pair of vans that look very similar  in appearance but are night and day build quality / comfort / durability.Original Review:Fit true to size, very comfy. looks great.  Likem.

There are pro’s and con’s with these. They look great and the fit is good. However the soles are the thinnest on any shoes I have ever seen. You will feel every pebble. Don’t count on these for everyday wear and definitely not if you need to walk or be active. They will not last two weeks of active use. But they will be fine to wear out to dinner or to the movies and will look great doing it. Style over substance is okay sometimes.

Not the puma quality I remember.  Aesthetically pleasing to the eye, stitching looks good.  Good grief they're good for standing on flat ground and that's about it.  The sole on these shoes is no more then a 1/4 inch thick and the rest is a honey comb like grid you can feel on your feet, and real slick, no grip whatsoever on damp ground.  Not to mention anything you step on, ouch!  Cracks in sidewalks, pebbles you can feel everything you step on that isn't flat.  You can see the triangle shapes poking through my heel from the grid in the picture from the hollow sole.  Sorry a little rainy here, a bit dirty.  What a shame, they sucked the sole out of that mighty cat and jacked the price!  Not buying those again.

I've been a loyal Puma man for years now and I picked up some of these. The first pair fell apart pretty quickly but I didn't t think too much about it.  Puma has always been great to me. But the second pair did the same thing. Besides having zero support, I mean I could feel the design on the sole.  The inside heel  area on both pair torn apart within a month.I bought me the same pair but in the classics, and it's night and day. I showed them to the wife just to confirm, and she saw a noticeable difference in quality.Save some frustration and kick down more for a better pair.  You will be glad that you did.

On time, but not as described. I have bought a number of Puma shoes over the years, and they usually run a little small. This pair is much larger than I expected. I would rate them as large for any shoe brand, but really large for Puma.

Bought a pair like this last year and it did not fit as narrow

If you buy these shoes u won't be disappointed! My son is rough on shoes & they are still holding up. They are also easy to clean; u just wipe them off with a wet cloth & u are good to go!

I put them on and just ran. I don't know why but I wanted to so I ran, I ran so far away. It was great. They say Puma on the side which I thought was weird, I would have preferred another animal but I still like them enough to wear them to church with my clean outfit.

Great “fashion” sneaker.  Even though it’s ”old school”, it’s very comfortable and the width is great in the forefoot.  I have a wide foot and it’s really comfortable.  I have a pretty flat foot and added a slim orthotic for additional support.  Looks great with jeans or khaki shorts in the summer.
"
345,"
I've not had these even 2 months and they are already almost wore through on the sole and the insole is shot.Uppers seem very well made but what good is that if the sole disintegrates?I am on my feet a lot but I don't really do a lot of walking so this is unexpected disappointing.

...but they don't even make them in anything close to wide. The normal sized shoe they sell looks like a ski. Which is ashamed, because I'd buy one of every color if they had wides... real wides, I figure wide for them would be a human sized regular. I don't know, maybe Europeans are narrow of foot.

We ordered these for my son to grow into. He had a pair that he currently wore and these were on sale so I bought them. Because it took him a few months to grow into them the return window was closed when the insole started to disintegrate. I contacted Puma to purchase a pair of replacement insoles and they do not carry them and referred me to the seller which is Amazon. Amazon stated the return window was closed so they couldn’t help. This is just 6 or 7 wears. I included the bottom of the show to show they have barely been worn and a photo of the insole.

I wear size 12 in every brand of every shoe, and have had multiple pairs of Pumas and Adidas in size 12. These are SNUG and hurt my toes. It runs very small for a size 12 and will squish your feet and toes until they hurt.I've checked local stores and tried on size 12s there - no issues.

Pumas are my shoes of choice.  I have several pairs and plan to get move.  BUT - This pair/model is built like a pair of 1990 Rockport or Reebok shoes.  The styling and the amount of comfort/support jammed in.  They are so dorky and went back.

I had purchased other Puma Shoes from amazon, That lasted me a while. I had expected similar with these. These, Within 2 weeks the sole of the show has broken down, Every time I step i feel the "" square rubber"" from failing inserts. It has been a little over a month now and I will need to be replacing them very soon. I won't be replacing them with PUMA. I'm not a big guy, and if the other shoes can handle it for 6 months + these from the same company shouldn't fail in 2 weeks. Sorry, These are junk. Payless Had better shoes.

Update: 3 and 1/2 months and the insole is shot. I wear these shoes 6 - 8 hours a week on the racquetball court. Puma should be ashamed of themselves.Original review: Rated stars Overall the shoe is OK. I have sensitive feet and the sole is a little thin for me. Purchased for use on a hardwood court. They will be OK, but I would not purchase again for my intended use. May be OK for walking around.

Well, I do not think they are real Suede leather, more a sintetic suede to me, that looks nice (see pictures loattached). They are a little narrow & fit small too, at least 1/2 size, so I ordered half size up from my usual size (10.5 to 11 US) and that made the trick! You also will need a few days to strech & brake them down. Other than that, they're more than ok, and look like really nice old school sneakers 👌

I wear a women's size 7, so I ordered a men's size 5.5 and they fit perfectly.  Super comfortable.  I searched high and low for a nice pair of shoes in the color and style I liked, and I wasn't finding anything in the women's department. Very, very difficult to find a men's 5.5, and then if you do, to find one in stock.  Always loved Pumas and going to continue buying them because these are very nicely made.  The craftsmanship is just quality, with no imperfections or cheap-looking junk on them.  Also, why are all the shoes on Amazon, or excuse me, 99% of the shoes on Amazon, currently unavailable? Thank you, Puma for actually having the shoes that you advertise available for purchase.  That is, after all, the point.  I needed them asap for work, and they showed up in less than 2 days.  Perfect colors for my job requirements.  Nice to be able to buy some work shoes that I actually would wear even when not at work instead of having to buy some nasty embarrassing shoes that make me feel like some sort of matronly dweeb and not in a good way.

This tennis shoe is nice looking neat appearance. I have several pairs of puma classic suede tennis shoes that is one reason i knew about how they might fit which is good.One thing people might need to be made clear of is that this tennis shoe is leather suede upper the tongue of the shoe is material sole is rubber and the body is suede leather based on the labeling and my observation. The reason i bring this up is that the description on line says 100% synthectic thats a selling point the body of the shoe is real leather suede. Hop this helps.

The product came in packaged in the puma box. Brand new (not returned and then redistributed). The shoe looks great and the suede is nice. They spot a little if your caught out in the rain. The tow box is a little more narrow than I’m used to. Arch is ok. Over all they are a little tight. They are the correct size me.  One size up would be too big and one size down would’ve been tight and I would have returned them.  My suggestion, if you have a wide foot, this is really not for you. This is not their fault but had the toe box been a little wider, they would have gotten 5 stars.

Great looking sneaker.  That's the positive.  The negative, reality, is that this sneaker is, by far, the tightest, harshest fit across the top of my foot of any sneaker that I have purchased in the past 45 years.  After 20 minutes of wearing these Puma sneakers on an airplane flight, for example, I had to take them off just to get circulation back.  No exaggeration.  Same when I'm sitting in a chair in my office.Size 13 (my normal sneaker) with a thin sock.  I'm 6'2, 210 lbs, athletic build, medium foot width.  For now, I'm stuck with these because I foolishly tossed the Puma box - - cannot return these Puma sneakers or I would do so in a NY minute.  I've loosened up the laces, which gives these Puma sneakers a goofy, odd look aesthetically.  These Puma sneakers are going to the Salvation Army bin.

these shoes look cool.  they are like walking on the ground barefoot though, like paper thin bottoms.  Also, they seem to be narrow, but after wearing a day or so at work they stretched a little.

I ordered the blue sneakers and while they look good, they are definitely a cheaper version of the classic and they are 100% NOT suede, hence -2 stars. I have a black pair from a couple years back and those are absolutely Suede and considerably more comfortable. These are a synthetic copy of the original. I don't know why the description indicates these are suede. If you look at the pictures of the blue, the 1st picture is what you will receive. You will notice in the other pictures, the shoes ARE suede as you can see the difference in the amount of furryness (lol) which is what they would look like if they were legit suede.

Comfortable, supportive, stylish and reasonably priced.When I start to feel the insoles wearing  down, I get a pair of the Superfeet insoles and I get more mileage from the sneakers. The sneaker itself never rips or falls apart.The only reason I get a brand new pair is because sole gets some wear and tear.

I'm a regular size guy, who wears a regular size 10...not a wide, not a slim, but a regular size 10 like you find anywhere you look.  But these aren't those shoes.  These are made for small, thin feet, probably not unlike the person who made them.  One supposes the foot blanks used to size these shoes are modeled on thinner framed feet.  It's not that the leather won't eventually stretch (the one's I got are suede).  it's that the rubber sole is about 3/16ths of an inch too narrow, so I can feel the edges of my feet in the toe box resting on the rubber outsole walls.  I wore them for a few weeks to see if they would break in, but all that did is make things more pronounced.  As the insole molded to my foot, I could feel the outsole walls more and more.Great shoes if you have feet like skis and normally find shoes are too wide in the toe box.

I had a pair of these when I was a kid and they were probably some of the most comfortable shoes I ever had.  I bought them out of nostalgia and was not disappointed when they arrived and I put them on!  It was like running into an old friend after not seeing each other for years.  Love them so much I ordered a pair and had them delivered to my best friend who used to loot my closet when we were kids.  It wasn't unusual for me to show up at school and spot him coming down the hall totally decked out in clothes that all belonged to me and which I had no idea were even missing from my closet.  His review was very similar to mine.  Highly recommended and will continue purchasing these until I am too old and crippled to rock sneakers any more!

This is my first pair of Pumas that I have bought in a very long time, I usually buy Adidas or Nike shoes.  The look of the shoe is clean and classic looking, with the slate blue Puma stripe complimenting the darker blue of the rest of the shoe.  Having said that, the fit of the shoe (especially in the toe box) is really tight starting from the middle of the shoe.  I am hoping that the shoes will expand a little after breaking them in.

I know Puma runs small,  ordered a size up and still a bit narrow,  but they'll probably break in OK.  Took almost two weeks to get here WITH prime and showed up WITHOUT A SHOEBOX.

This is my first pair of Pumas . These shoes started falling apart after 4 days. I'm wondering if these are counterfeit. If not, these are complete garbage. Would not buy another pair.

I really like the looks of this shoe, very comfortable, but the quality is rubbish.I bought 2 pairs (different colors), and it's only been 5 months, I only wear each pair 50% of the time, and the insides on BOTH pairs are coming apart. I'm about as ""low impact"" as you can get. I sit in front of a computer screen all day for a job. Can you guys step it up and produce a better quality shoe?

Most puma are wide width, not this pair narrow, and no socks for better fit.

I love this sneaker. Fits great even though this style of footwear usually hurts my big toes because usually they are  narrow and my feet are wide. Somehow they look the same as similar sneakers but fit better than any other. Style is great and I also have them in navy / white and I had to get a black / white one without the swoosh being white and this one was perfect. Even the gold Puma logo fits better with black than any other color. Simply awesome shoes, very very comfortable with their memory foam type insole and they look great!

After having these shoes less than 60 days and not being worn that much (maybe 6 times) there is a rip by the eyelets.  This is my 3rd pair of these shoes and never experienced an issue until now.  Terrible quality!!!
"

They fit well, but out of all the shoes I have purchased since 2019 these are the most uncomfortable :( Sad because I really like them. They make my feet feel tired and achy After I wear them for about 8hrs like I do all my other shoes.

My son picked these out as a Christmas gift.  The shoes are exceptional.  The material is strong.  This is the second pair, different color of this brand of shoe.  He wears them every day and they last years.  Well worth every dollar!  I Purchased them at Amazon the last first shoe purchase.  Amazon had the best price.

I can defiantly notice the quality is not as good as PUMA's in the very past. The show bends weird in the middle when you walk loosening the fit. You can just tell they are made in China.
"

I've always liked Puma Suede Classics. The price is great. The quality is great. They're comfortable for me. The sizing is a little off. You might have to go a half size larger or even one full size larger. Either way, you won't be disappointed though.

Idk why anyone would rate these negatively. I paid $19.99 for some pumas!!!?. Hands down best deal I’ve ever gotten on a pair of shoes! The product is quality and fit as intended. I mean if you’re thinking these are like  sports shoes then you’re mistaken. They are meant for everyday use with like going out, school, or work. If you’re looking for sports shoes then you definitely want to go the nike or adidas route.

Comfortable  sneaker, fits like a glove. Great addition to my Puma collection.
"

This is the first pair of shoes I felt compelled to return. These shoes are extremely narrow. I wore the shoes for all but 2 minutes and after I took them off, the middle of my foot felt extremely constricted. If you have even slightly wide feet, you should steer clear of this shoe.
"
1172,"
I wanted to echo what other have said. The heel area of the internal sole disintegrated after a few weeks of casual wearing. I had to replace them with Dr. Schol's. Who know how long they will last. I will likely have to replace the pair of shoes entirely. Poor design, they don't last.
"
1173,"
I love the fit, the look and how fast they arrived!
"
1174,"
Like the title says. I don't usually wear socks, so breaking in new shoes can be a pain. These are already breaking in fairly painlessly, and for the money and being able to get it in size 14, I really cannot complain. Just a good all-around walking shoe, albeit one without a mountain of arch support (so if you need a fairly sizeable lump under your arch, look elsewhere).
"
1175,"
I bought these shoes for work (restaurant) and they are great, but they run very tight. I bought a 9 originally (I’ve bought 9 for Puma before) but I had to re-order a 9.5 instead. They’re light and flat, which is why I like them since I’m on my feet 8hrs a day, 5 days a week. Definitely a good buy with the right size.

I purchased this pair just before X-mas, thinking they would be a brand new pair of shoes to gift. What I got was a damaged box, dirty shoes due to the box condition and evidence it had been returned from another customer in November. Very disappointed from a brand like Puma, they didn’t even care to change the shoes’ box.
"
1180,"
Just got these and wearing for the first time today . Left one is pinching my little toe so I may need to wear them some and break them in ? Hopefully I won't need to return them. I enjoy them and don't want to return but if they keep up with the pinching I will.
"
1181,"
I like the sneakers.
"
1182,"
Not a vey comfortable shoe.  Very little in the way of cushion and zero arch support.  Removed the insole and replaced with thicker one, made some difference but wouldn't recommend for anything other than casual (non-athletic) use.  Tends to wear on the warm/hot side.
"
1183,"
Took 7 days to get here and was undersized. Replacement was going to take 7 weeks! Getting a refund. Size 11 is not size 11. Order a 12.I liked them so much I bought a pair directly from Puma. Still breaking them in as they make my feat ache after a few hours.
"

My boyfriend wears an 11 and has two other pairs of Puma's similar in style, and these ran small - had to exchange them for a 12. But super easy exchange and got the new pair in a few days!
"

The shoe was a fun color...  but lets face it they are not the most comfortable shoe on the market.  That being said, if you want to try something that is a little different looking and add a flair to what you are wearing go for it.

So, apparently shoemakers have juggled their sizing criteria.  In the last six months, I have had to return every pair of shoes or boots that I have ordered online and get one size larger.  Oddly, I have worn the same size shoe since high school, and shoes bought two years ago in that size fit fine.  Seems to me that someone is cutting corners to save a few bucks.  Maybe I should stop buying online and make my lazy self actually go to a real store.

I love Puma Sneakers not just because they look really cool, and they do look really cool by the way, but because they are really comfortable and also Puma tends to run a tad bit wider than most other big name brands, and since i have slightly wider feet Puma always fits me just right

Pumas have always been too narrow in the toe box for me, but I don't care for 'dad sneakers"" so I tried again. These fit well and are cushy. The suede is warmer than canvas and stretches a bit too conform to your foot. They have a foam footbed similar to the Adidas cloudfoam, so good for standing on concrete all day. I can't attest to the durability yet, and I wouldn't wear them in foul weather, but they are stylie and a good bargain.

Size 13: Shoe runs tight and short for it's label size. Maybe they'll loosen after being broken in, I'd order half a size larger next time.Quality craftsmanship and materials.

I have bought pumas almost exclusively for the last 20+ years. I buy about 2 piars, black and blue, and wear them for about a year. The old pairs go to outdoor work shoes and the new ones for work. I bought these in May but really started wearing them in September. Just saw this rip on the side yesterday and I don't remember hitting anything shape that could have ripped it. Honestly this is a first for this happening. Super disappointed hope this isn't a sigh of quality issues and more of the same in the future.

Came really clean, being delivered I was worried they'd have scuffs but the shoe was perfect that way. I've always worn 10.5US so I didn't hesitate to order that size, however with these shoes they are a bit narrow for my feet (I have wider feet). I've never owned a pair of Pumas before so not sure if this is normal for the brand. All around a nice and comfy shoe still and I will be able to wear regularly once broke in a bit.

I usually wear Adidas Cloudfoam shoes, but I'm now switching to Puma for a while because they are incredibly comfortable!

Updated review:I've never worn out a set of shoes so quickly.  The first few months they were pretty good / comfortable, but quickly the foam / sole sort of just thinned out.  After about 5 months I wore completely through the sole, and cracks developed that would allow water to go through the sole.  Plus they became very uncomfortable.  I really treated these shoes with kid gloves.  Typically I ruin shoes due to hiking in them, biking, and running.  I only walked around in these as I have other specific shoes for those activities (not always the case in my younger years).Also, even when brand new these shoes could not keep water out.  The upper portion of the shoe will wick water quickly.  Even on just wet streets (not puddles) your feet get soaked.  I have since bought a pair of vans that look very similar  in appearance but are night and day build quality / comfort / durability.Original Review:Fit true to size, very comfy. looks great.  Likem.

There are pro’s and con’s with these. They look great and the fit is good. However the soles are the thinnest on any shoes I have ever seen. You will feel every pebble. Don’t count on these for everyday wear and definitely not if you need to walk or be active. They will not last two weeks of active use. But they will be fine to wear out to dinner or to the movies and will look great doing it. Style over substance is okay sometimes.

Not the puma quality I remember.  Aesthetically pleasing to the eye, stitching looks good.  Good grief they're good for standing on flat ground and that's about it.  The sole on these shoes is no more then a 1/4 inch thick and the rest is a honey comb like grid you can feel on your feet, and real slick, no grip whatsoever on damp ground.  Not to mention anything you step on, ouch!  Cracks in sidewalks, pebbles you can feel everything you step on that isn't flat.  You can see the triangle shapes poking through my heel from the grid in the picture from the hollow sole.  Sorry a little rainy here, a bit dirty.  What a shame, they sucked the sole out of that mighty cat and jacked the price!  Not buying those again.

Puma's suede sneakers fit my feet better than any other sneaker out there other than the waaaay over priced flimsy chuck taylors (they were $12.00) when I was in High School.

Never owned Pumas before.  After I received them I have to say they might be the best casual sneakers I've owned.  They didn't require any lace adjustments at all.  The interior is cushioned, I haven't felt any foot fatigue yet even after walking a few miles.  They did not need to be broken in at all.

I have style, that's what all the girls say. My pumas are perfect. Black and mysterious, these shoes sneak into presentations, the hottest clubs, and fine dining establishments. I think they might be leather. My black pumas are the true son of wakanda. Lots of sole, plenty of power.

I've been a loyal Puma man for years now and I picked up some of these. The first pair fell apart pretty quickly but I didn't t think too much about it.  Puma has always been great to me. But the second pair did the same thing. Besides having zero support, I mean I could feel the design on the sole.  The inside heel  area on both pair torn apart within a month.I bought me the same pair but in the classics, and it's night and day. I showed them to the wife just to confirm, and she saw a noticeable difference in quality.Save some frustration and kick down more for a better pair.  You will be glad that you did.

On time, but not as described. I have bought a number of Puma shoes over the years, and they usually run a little small. This pair is much larger than I expected. I would rate them as large for any shoe brand, but really large for Puma.

I put them on and just ran. I don't know why but I wanted to so I ran, I ran so far away. It was great. They say Puma on the side which I thought was weird, I would have preferred another animal but I still like them enough to wear them to church with my clean outfit.

Great “fashion” sneaker.  Even though it’s ”old school”, it’s very comfortable and the width is great in the forefoot.  I have a wide foot and it’s really comfortable.  I have a pretty flat foot and added a slim orthotic for additional support.  Looks great with jeans or khaki shorts in the summer.
"

I've not had these even 2 months and they are already almost wore through on the sole and the insole is shot.Uppers seem very well made but what good is that if the sole disintegrates?I am on my feet a lot but I don't really do a lot of walking so this is unexpected disappointing.

...but they don't even make them in anything close to wide. The normal sized shoe they sell looks like a ski. Which is ashamed, because I'd buy one of every color if they had wides... real wides, I figure wide for them would be a human sized regular. I don't know, maybe Europeans are narrow of foot.

We ordered these for my son to grow into. He had a pair that he currently wore and these were on sale so I bought them. Because it took him a few months to grow into them the return window was closed when the insole started to disintegrate. I contacted Puma to purchase a pair of replacement insoles and they do not carry them and referred me to the seller which is Amazon. Amazon stated the return window was closed so they couldn’t help. This is just 6 or 7 wears. I included the bottom of the show to show they have barely been worn and a photo of the insole.

I wear size 12 in every brand of every shoe, and have had multiple pairs of Pumas and Adidas in size 12. These are SNUG and hurt my toes. It runs very small for a size 12 and will squish your feet and toes until they hurt.I've checked local stores and tried on size 12s there - no issues. These appear to have a size 12 tag sewn onto a size 11 shoe. NOT TRUE TO SIZE, too small. I'm very disappointed.

Right shoe pinches a bone on my large toe in an awkward and uncomfortable manner. Regardless of how I adjust the laces, it HURTS to wear these.Really odd. I’ve never had this problem with any other pair of shoes. It does not occur with the 5 other pairs of sneakers I have in rotation.

Pumas are my shoes of choice.  I have several pairs and plan to get move.  BUT - This pair/model is built like a pair of 1990 Rockport or Reebok shoes.  The styling and the amount of comfort/support jammed in.  They are so dorky and went back.

I had purchased other Puma Shoes from amazon, That lasted me a while. I had expected similar with these. These, Within 2 weeks the sole of the show has broken down, Every time I step i feel the "" square rubber"" from failing inserts. It has been a little over a month now and I will need to be replacing them very soon. I won't be replacing them with PUMA. I'm not a big guy, and if the other shoes can handle it for 6 months + these from the same company shouldn't fail in 2 weeks. Sorry, These are junk. Payless Had better shoes.

Update: 3 and 1/2 months and the insole is shot. I wear these shoes 6 - 8 hours a week on the racquetball court. Puma should be ashamed of themselves.Original review: Rated stars Overall the shoe is OK. I have sensitive feet and the sole is a little thin for me. Purchased for use on a hardwood court. They will be OK, but I would not purchase again for my intended use. May be OK for walking around.

Well, I do not think they are real Suede leather, more a sintetic suede to me, that looks nice (see pictures loattached). They are a little narrow & fit small too, at least 1/2 size, so I ordered half size up from my usual size (10.5 to 11 US) and that made the trick! You also will need a few days to strech & brake them down. Other than that, they're more than ok, and look like really nice old school sneakers 👌

My fiancé wanted these for working out and for him to start running. He said he wore them around the house to break them in and he felt like he didn’t even need to do that!

I do a great deal of walking, and go to the gym a couple of times a week, and after about a month and a half of wearing these shoes I am very happy with them. They have what feels like a layer of memory foam on the insole, which I figured would flatten in no time, but so far it has held up.They also dry quickly, which I didn't think would be the case with that insole. A few times I've had to take a long walk in melting snow and figured I had ruined them, but a few hours later they're good as newWhen I first put them on, I noticed the outer sole was very stiff, and considered returning them for this reason because it felt odd. I don't know how much it has softened versus how much I've simply become accustomed to it, but now they just feel sturdy and I have come to appreciate this feature.

They look great ,very comfortable but they weren’t worth $65 . If you look at the rear it’s way off looks uneven. I bought them to only wear in the house they have the durability of a sock and I wouldn’t wear them outside. After 30 years of NIKES I wanted a change and also didn’t wanna pay 175 every time for sneakers , looks like they were always worth it . These are what I would consider a fake brand of sneaker quality. I might still try the old school suede PUMAS . But if you can only get one pair of sneakers these AINT IT.

 My review is admittedly askew in the sense that due to conditions they quickly became daily shows which I am fairly rough on by doing indoor and outdoor general labor/ handyman work. With that I'd say they were quite comfortable initially but I broke them in quick but the only issue I'd say is that I need to get some inserts as I've nearly worn through the padding inside at the ball of my feet, however still have tread on the bottom. Other than that, they've held together well. No holes or tears in the mesh. A little thread fraying but again I'd put that more of a result of quite vigorous daily usage. If they can be used as just running shoes or workout shoes then I think they'd have lasted much longer and remained in much better shape. Although looking at them after these last few months, I think they'd still look pretty good if I cleaned them up. You can judge in the video though.

I didn’t buy these shoes for running or even working out, so I can’t say on that. I bought them really for everyday shoes. You know, my go to. Because I have always liked Puma and the fact that they are black. I tend to get white shoes dirty rather quickly and I don’t do all the fancy cleaners and such. I bought a pair of Adidas size 13 and they were way too big on my feet and had to return them. I know Puma’s have always run a little small so I ordered these Puma’s in size 13. Wow, I have never had a size 13 fit me so small! They hurt my feet and were very tight across the toes. But I really liked them so I went ahead and bought some shoe stretchers and they worked great! Now I love the shoes. I got a good deal on the shoes, so I didn’t mind spending the money for the stretchers and I fiqure I may need them again. Would recommend but keep that sizing in mind

This is the second pair of Axelion Running Shoes that I purchased. The first pair (purchased about 15 months ago) provided fantastic support, traction, and had a great fit. They also were very well made and high quality.

Puma is about the only shoe I can wear that fits properly. Nike, Adidas, and all the other popular brands are for people with flat-fat feet. I have a narrow foot and Puma is the one shoemaker who makes shoes for narrow feet without special ordering them. They last a long while, they hold up well, and they don't get that horrible smell as they get older. Most importantly, they are comfortable all day and help minimize fatigue. If you are outside the norm of the obese-oversized America that we have become, then Puma is the shoe for people with small, narrow feet.

I’ve been tempted, for a long time, to try the Puma brand. My selection is comfortable and looks good. The air support system is very soothing and great for general use and long walks. The arch support is adequate. However, these shoes run a full size smaller than advertised. After some use I believe the extended lacing is more of a gimmick, serving no real practical purpose. There is absolutely no protection for the end of the toes and the lateral support is not adequate. I would suggest these shoes as a casual about-town shoe but not necessarily a true running or workout shoe.

The foam cushion took about a day to get used to- it really is spongy!- but now I can't wait to start using them to work out. I am a 12 and the shoes started a bit snug but I can feel them loosening up. Bottom line: very happy with these PUMAs.

Most comfortable sneaker ever. Memory foam insert. Very well built. 60.00 cheaper than a nike, and better than a nike. fits like a glove.  Love them I will continue to buy these till they either don't make them no more or they make a version 2.0
"

The soft memory foam insole is way too soft. And like some one else said, it pushes your feet forward to a slight degree.  I was going to return these but missed it by a day.  Fortunately I have another pair of Puma’s with a much firmer foot bed that is thicker in the fore foot area.  It fits perfectly and keeps the foot from moving fWd.  It also offers a lot more support. So at least now I can use these shoes.  I would give them a 5 star rating with the proper insole.

Probably the most comfortable shoe I've worn in a long time, but unfortunately the mesh fabric on the upper part of the shoe does attract a lot of dirt and debris. Hard to keep clean but a perfectly built active running and Athletics shoe. I will definitely be purchasing another color way

Love almost everything about this shoe. It's light, comfortable, easy to put on, good support. The rings on the tongue and heel are great. The main downside: they offer absolutely ZERO protection against water. The material absorbs water like cotton, and gets your feet wet in an instant. Maybe invest in some of that hydrophobic spray?

These shoes looked great right out of the box. About 2 weeks after he started wearing them, the right shoe developed a hole around the toes. It is just on the outer layer of the shoe.

I have a few pairs of pumas. I wouldn’t  recommend these for rainy days because your feet will definitely get wet through the shoes. Also if you plan on using these shoes for running they tend to hold onto moister and can get very smelly very quick. Other than that, they’re dope.

Very soft, bouncy insole.For me they fit perfectly out of the box no break in needed.Arch support is great as well, not too high. More of a moderate curve.

These are great shoes.  I've had them for over a year now and they are holding up well.  I use them all day for walking around the house, walking the dog in the neighborhood and generally when I'm going out somewhere where tennis shoes fit in.  I don't wear them for running or exercise walks of long duration.  The comfort and support are excellent.  I did order a size 11.5 instead of my usual 11.  My experience with Puma athletic shoes [many different styles/ types] is that they won't accommodate my high instep without an extra 1/2 size.  That extra length also makes the toe box more comfortable as these shoes taper noticeably at the toe.  I also get a lot of compliments and questions about where I bought them.

Comfortable and all out attractive shoe, however not much arch support. Instead of walking or running specific, I am wearing them for an everyday wear around sneaker.  I'd say they're worth what I paid.

Sneaker's are usually a 9.5 for me when there is a tapering at the toe and these fit perfectly (great for thin socks) - no break in period required.  The design and construction of these definitely resonate with me; sleek, light, comfortable and  aesthetically interesting; reflective of a puma (higher in the rear heel design).  These are not made for long runs but more for walking and are extremely comfortable.

I have trouble finding shoes that fit well. The arch placement in many brands are mis-aligned with my arches. This is the second pair of Puma Axelion sneakers. The soles showed very little wear despite over 8 months of daily wear, though the inserts have flattened. I still wear the old sneakers when I am working around the house, cutting the grass, and walking the dog. They are still very comfortable, but my rabbit chewed through one of the shoe string guides.I expect to buy this shoe again, and again. If you like the fit of Nike, this might not be the shoe for you. However, if Asics or Adidas have been good in the past, I'd give this one a try.Personally, this is the best fitting shoe I have found in the last decade.

Not sure what happened to Puma athletic shoes.  These fit like a size too small, and the toe box is incredibly cramped.  I used to wear Puma for running and working out and they had ample room, were exceptionally comfortable.  These Axelions are NOT - they are small, tight, cramped and generally uncomfortable.  Insole not very comfortable, and outsole is hard and slippery.  I had always preferred Puma over Adidas but lately I'm switching my preference.Update - these have cramped my feet so much that I've changed my rating to one star, and I'm donating them.  These run very small, have no room in the toe box, and are not the Puma quality I was used to.  Beyond disappointed in them.

I am not a fan of the new style with the larger than life soles that go up the sides.  These take the extreme opposite approach and you can barely see the sole in the front.  Great looking shoe.

These shoes are very very nice looking. With that said, I should have read the reviews beforehand because they do cause your foot to slide forward and push your toes up against the tip of the shoes. The material they are made of and with that issue, if anything were to drag across the toe area of the shoe they will definitely not last long. I am super bummed because I loved how they looked, they are quite light, and was super excited about them. Unfortunately, I will have to return them.

We bought these for a teenager about 3.5 months ago. These are his everyday shoes, used in PE at school but not for athletics. This is not a kid who abuses his shoes, yet they are already very broken down. The interior lining has frayed to the point of ripping open, and some of the foamy material inside the shoe frequently ends up on our carpet. The soles are more worn down than they should be at this point. Likewise for the interior support. We bought an identical pair of these shoes for another child from another retailer and had the same experience. I'm not quick to write negative reviews but these shoes were not a good purchase.

I buy mostly Puma sneakers and I have many.  They are sleek and durable.  They are generally tighter than your average sneaker and some are tighter than the other.  I have this particular one Black-white and also have White-gray Violet and this one is not as comfortable and felt heavier as the other one.  Eventually, I got my small scale and weighed both of them.  The first one (Black-white) is 465 gram vs 437 gram for the second one (White-gray Violet). about 60 gram heavier.  Also, White-gray Violet  more comfortable and my feet feels cooler than the Black-white.

I wear size 11 shoes. I really love the concept with theses shoes. Design and color. When I tried them on, they were very comfortable. Only one problem. The memory foam insole didn't go all the way to the toe. So my toes clutched the edge of the memory foam like an eagle perched up in a tree. I got used to it but it wasn't as comfortable as it could be. Since i had worn them too much to return, I bought another pair. This time size 12. Perfect fit. Super comfortable. I can wear these all day and my feet don't hurt.

I dont wear these shoes very often except at home or to work on casual Friday. They are a great fit and very comfortable. That being said, the rubber on the sole at the heel of the shoe is coming apart on both shoes. This is the 1st pair of Pumas that I have owned that have been such poor quality.

Got them yesterday, and honestly wasn’t expecting them to come so quickly. I’m ecstatic about it though because I’ve been needing new running shoes. They look more beautiful in person than they did online. They are a little snug, but I expected that where they are new and need to get broken in. The soles are memory foam which was awesome to find out. Overall I’m very happy with my purchase and will be ordering more pairs in the near future.

Less than 8 months of minimal use and they are falling apart… Husband works from home and wore these occasionally as his “nice shoes”. Never used for exercise or vigorous activities. Bummed that I spent this much on a gift for them to last much less than his 15 dollar Walmart shoes.
"
2348,"
A sleek looking shoe, especially for a wide. the width I thought was excellent. The airlift insoles feel great. The only downsides were the toe is a little boxy and wider then I would like and the first day I wore them, the lace strap snapped on the inside of the right shoe. I saw at least one other review where this happened. I contacted the seller (Amazon in my case) they are replacing the shoes with a new pair.
"
2349,"
Nice color
"

These shoes are not great at all. Zero toe support and the shoes in general are just not comfy. I ordered a 12 and these are a 13 and they are still a tad snug.When I walk my foot will shift forward and my toe will be up against the front of the shoe.I have had better Walmart shoes to be honest. Never again
"
2351,"
I'm a 9 US in most shoes, and the 9 fit me pretty well. I got these after using up my Tazon's 6, and they fit pretty much the same. I bought these instead of the Tazon's because of the shoelace and mesh design. I use these to run and I haven't had an issue with them.
"

I forgot how much I love Pumas!  I haven't worn a pair of pumas in about 5 years and I don't know why. I absolutely love this pair! They are comfy and have a perfect balance of light and dark tones.

Very comfortable but don’t walk through wet grass or the adhesive will separate. Ive bought 3 different pair of Puma shoes this year and not a single pair lasted over 3 months of normal wear. The craftsmanship just gets cheaper and product price goes up…I won’t be buying anymore from Puma until they bring back the Vedano driving shoes. Why would they stop making their only quality shoes? It’s sickening. I’m switching back to Adidas.

My delivery date for these shoes were August 16, 2021. Today's date is September 23, 2021. They have started to tear away where the rubber meets the fabric.  The stuff you see in the photo is shoe goo that I have used to put them back together. Everywhere you see the white/clear stuff is where I've had to glue it back together. For being Pumas you'd think their quality would be better. These shoes are only worn for 6 hours a day M-F. They aren't used as gum shoes or anything hing other than typical walking.

Right out of the box brand new these are really comfortable to wear around.  I usually wear an 11 or 11.5, in this case I ordered the 11.5 because Puma's web site says they tend to run small.  The 11.5 is perfect for me.  And I really like the way they look!

like the look and feel, but the back of the shoe is too tall and it rubs the back of my ankle/leg.  In part because the sole is very squishy so I sink down and rub along the way.I was excited to own Puma, now not sure what i will do with them.  wear taller socks

These are a soft, light shoe that let your feet breathe. Getting used to the laces being all the way down the sides was interesting but beyond that these are great looking and feeling shoes. I will definitely be getting another pair for my daily use.

These don't hold up to the puma name. I don't use these for exercising but they are my everyday sneaker. I've only had them for 4 months and I've already walked through the insole at my toes. I shouldn't have to buy new insoles this soon....

This is a minimalist-style shoe, with heel support. If you're into minimalist-style shoes, you might really like this shoe. If you're not, you'll hate it. It has pretty good heel support, but since it has absolutely zero support for the front half of your foot, the front part of your foot sits very close to the ground while your heel is up a half-inch, like high-heels. This awkward position makes your shins get worked really hard as you awkwardly walk around trying to keep your toes from up. It's probably something you'd get used to, but feels like it will cause shin splints initially.Toe box is also narrow; shoe is narrow, and the ""high heel"" effect further causes your foot to slide down and forward, pressing your toes towards the end of the shoe.Pros:Shoe looks nice. Feels like good quality. Will probably work well for you crazy lets-kill-our-joints cross-fit minimalist-shoe nuts.

These are not the same fit and feel as the Pumas they replaced. They are uncomfortable, tight and you can see the glue used form the soles.

I purchased these shoes in April of this year. After wearing maybe 7 or 8 times the right shoe heel inside frayed out to the outside piece.  The left has been perfect.  After contacting the vendor about the defective shoe they hid behind the Amazon 30 day return policy.  This doesn’t seem right as far as a warranty on Puma shoes. Buyer beware is the takeaway.  Are these counterfeit?  I’ve had store bought last much longer

They fell apart in a few months, with very-light use. The stitching on the side came out. In the past, my Pumas have lasted years. Disappointed in the quality.

From my experience, Pumas tend to run on the small side. But other than that, they’re just as described.

Yep, they look great, but they are the most uncomfortable shoes I've worn in awhile. Initially when I tried these on in the store I was pleased with how they felt, but throwing them on to walk around downtown I was amazing how painful it was to move around in them. Don't be fooled by the initial feel of these shoes ... steer clear and avoid blisters.

First of all my shoes did not come in a original box. Then I noticed the color was not quite the same on each shoe then I checked the numbers in the tongue but the Puma logo on the back of the shoe is a different size than the other. That is what you get when see a deal to good to be true. It is!

It didn’t have air pockets under the shoe like the Airmax, heels is hard uncomfortable

I really liked the style of the shoe. The biggest problem wasn’t the length of the shoe, it was true to size. The toe box was too small. It felt like the tops of my toes were very uncomfortable due to the height of the toe box.

I do a great deal of walking, and go to the gym a couple of times a week, and after about a month and a half of wearing these shoes I am very happy with them. They have what feels like a layer of memory foam on the insole, which I figured would flatten in no time, but so far it has held up.They also dry quickly, which I didn't think would be the case with that insole. A few times I've had to take a long walk in melting snow and figured I had ruined them, but a few hours later they're good as newWhen I first put them on, I noticed the outer sole was very stiff, and considered returning them for this reason because it felt odd. I don't know how much it has softened versus how much I've simply become accustomed to it, but now they just feel sturdy and I have come to appreciate this feature.

They look great ,very comfortable but they weren’t worth $65 . If you look at the rear it’s way off looks uneven. I bought them to only wear in the house they have the durability of a sock and I wouldn’t wear them outside. After 30 years of NIKES I wanted a change and also didn’t wanna pay 175 every time for sneakers , looks like they were always worth it . These are what I would consider a fake brand of sneaker quality. I might still try the old school suede PUMAS . But if you can only get one pair of sneakers these AINT IT.

 My review is admittedly askew in the sense that due to conditions they quickly became daily shows which I am fairly rough on by doing indoor and outdoor general labor/ handyman work. With that I'd say they were quite comfortable initially but I broke them in quick but the only issue I'd say is that I need to get some inserts as I've nearly worn through the padding inside at the ball of my feet, however still have tread on the bottom. Other than that, they've held together well. No holes or tears in the mesh. A little thread fraying but again I'd put that more of a result of quite vigorous daily usage. If they can be used as just running shoes or workout shoes then I think they'd have lasted much longer and remained in much better shape. Although looking at them after these last few months, I think they'd still look pretty good if I cleaned them up. You can judge in the video though.

My husband uses them to work out and he really likes them. These were a gift to replace his old Pumas that had started to show their age. I've ALWAYS loved Puma shoes, I also ONLY wear their socks, and I buy my toddler girls Puma socks. Their socks are great for those who are bothered by the seam in some socks.

I didn’t buy these shoes for running or even working out, so I can’t say on that. I bought them really for everyday shoes. You know, my go to. Because I have always liked Puma and the fact that they are black. I tend to get white shoes dirty rather quickly and I don’t do all the fancy cleaners and such. I bought a pair of Adidas size 13 and they were way too big on my feet and had to return them. I know Puma’s have always run a little small so I ordered these Puma’s in size 13. Wow, I have never had a size 13 fit me so small! They hurt my feet and were very tight across the toes. But I really liked them so I went ahead and bought some shoe stretchers and they worked great! Now I love the shoes. I got a good deal on the shoes, so I didn’t mind spending the money for the stretchers and I fiqure I may need them again. Would recommend but keep that sizing in mind

This is the second pair of Axelion Running Shoes that I purchased. The first pair (purchased about 15 months ago) provided fantastic support, traction, and had a great fit. They also were very well made and high quality. This pair was a bit disappointing in fit, and the materials/construction was not to the same standards as the first pair.I love the lacing system on these as they provide a way to create a very snug and supportive fit around the arch.

Puma is about the only shoe I can wear that fits properly. Nike, Adidas, and all the other popular brands are for people with flat-fat feet. I have a narrow foot and Puma is the one shoemaker who makes shoes for narrow feet without special ordering them. They last a long while, they hold up well, and they don't get that horrible smell as they get older. Most importantly, they are comfortable all day and help minimize fatigue. If you are outside the norm of the obese-oversized America that we have become, then Puma is the shoe for people with small, narrow feet.

I’ve been tempted, for a long time, to try the Puma brand. My selection is comfortable and looks good. The air support system is very soothing and great for general use and long walks. The arch support is adequate. However, these shoes run a full size smaller than advertised. After some use I believe the extended lacing is more of a gimmick, serving no real practical purpose. There is absolutely no protection for the end of the toes and the lateral support is not adequate. I would suggest these shoes as a casual about-town shoe but not necessarily a true running or workout shoe.
"

Perfect combination of looks and comfort. I was worried the red would turn out to pink when I pulled them out of the box but they look exactly like they were listed. The foam cushion took about a day to get used to- it really is spongy!- but now I can't wait to start using them to work out. I am a 12 and the shoes started a bit snug but I can feel them loosening up. Bottom line: very happy with these PUMAs.
"
3132,"
Most comfortable sneaker ever. Memory foam insert. Very well built. 60.00 cheaper than a nike, and better than a nike. fits like a glove.  Love them I will continue to buy these till they either don't make them no more or they make a version 2.0
"
3133,"
The soft memory foam insole is way too soft. And like some one else said, it pushes your feet forward to a slight degree.  I was going to return these but missed it by a day.  Fortunately I have another pair of Puma’s with a much firmer foot bed that is thicker in the fore foot area.  It fits perfectly and keeps the foot from moving fWd.  It also offers a lot more support. So at least now I can use these shoes.  I would give them a 5 star rating with the proper insole.
"
3134,"
Probably the most comfortable shoe I've worn in a long time, but unfortunately the mesh fabric on the upper part of the shoe does attract a lot of dirt and debris. Hard to keep clean but a perfectly built active running and Athletics shoe. I will definitely be purchasing another color way

Love almost everything about this shoe. It's light, comfortable, easy to put on, good support. The rings on the tongue and heel are great. The main downside: they offer absolutely ZERO protection against water. The material absorbs water like cotton, and gets your feet wet in an instant. Maybe invest in some of that hydrophobic spray?

These shoes looked great right out of the box. About 2 weeks after he started wearing them, the right shoe developed a hole around the toes. It is just on the outer layer of the shoe.

I have a few pairs of pumas. I wouldn’t  recommend these for rainy days because your feet will definitely get wet through the shoes. Also if you plan on using these shoes for running they tend to hold onto moister and can get very smelly very quick. Other than that, they’re dope.

These are great shoes.  I've had them for over a year now and they are holding up well.  I use them all day for walking around the house, walking the dog in the neighborhood and generally when I'm going out somewhere where tennis shoes fit in.  I don't wear them for running or exercise walks of long duration.  The comfort and support are excellent.  I did order a size 11.5 instead of my usual 11.  My experience with Puma athletic shoes [many different styles/ types] is that they won't accommodate my high instep without an extra 1/2 size.  That extra length also makes the toe box more comfortable as these shoes taper noticeably at the toe.  I also get a lot of compliments and questions about where I bought them.

Sneaker's are usually a 9.5 for me when there is a tapering at the toe and these fit perfectly (great for thin socks) - no break in period required.

These are not made for long runs but more for walking and are extremely comfortable.

I have trouble finding shoes that fit well. The arch placement in many brands are mis-aligned with my arches. This is the second pair of Puma Axelion sneakers. The soles showed very little wear despite over 8 months of daily wear, though the inserts have flattened. I still wear the old sneakers when I am working around the house, cutting the grass, and walking the dog. They are still very comfortable, but my rabbit chewed through one of the shoe string guides.I expect to buy this shoe again, and again. If you like the fit of Nike, this might not be the shoe for you. However, if Asics or Adidas have been good in the past, I'd give this one a try.Personally, this is the best fitting shoe I have found in the last decade.

Not sure what happened to Puma athletic shoes.  These fit like a size too small, and the toe box is incredibly cramped.  I used to wear Puma for running and working out and they had ample room, were exceptionally comfortable.  These Axelions are NOT - they are small, tight, cramped and generally uncomfortable.  Insole not very comfortable, and outsole is hard and slippery.  I had always preferred Puma over Adidas but lately I'm switching my preference.Update - these have cramped my feet so much that I've changed my rating to one star, and I'm donating them.  These run very small, have no room in the toe box, and are not the Puma quality I was used to.  Beyond disappointed in them.

I am not a fan of the new style with the larger than life soles that go up the sides.  These take the extreme opposite approach and you can barely see the sole in the front.  Great looking shoe.  Very comfortable memory foam type insole.  The laces are a little tricky but if you just pull from the sides of the shoe instead of the top like traditional, you'll be alright.

Nice fitting shoe, but the pictures of the shoe here on Amazon are misleading.  It says they are black, but more like a grey color than black.  I still would have purchased anyways, but I wanted black and not grey.

These shoes are very very nice looking. With that said, I should have read the reviews beforehand because they do cause your foot to slide forward and push your toes up against the tip of the shoes. The material they are made of and with that issue, if anything were to drag across the toe area of the shoe they will definitely not last long. I am super bummed because I loved how they looked, they are quite light, and was super excited about them. Unfortunately, I will have to return them.

Purchased these for back to school for my grandson. He’s worn them only to school for less than six weeks and the soles have separated from the top of the shoe.  He should be able to wear these at recess and PE— it’s a sports shoe after all.  Would not purchase again.

We bought these for a teenager about 3.5 months ago. These are his everyday shoes, used in PE at school but not for athletics. This is not a kid who abuses his shoes, yet they are already very broken down. The interior lining has frayed to the point of ripping open, and some of the foamy material inside the shoe frequently ends up on our carpet. The soles are more worn down than they should be at this point. Likewise for the interior support. We bought an identical pair of these shoes for another child from another retailer and had the same experience. I'm not quick to write negative reviews but these shoes were not a good purchase.

Faking assist from normal everyday wear by my 15 year old son.  Only to school, where the majority of thier time is seated.  Lining inside is pealing up from the cushioning and the outer mesh is tearing away from the rubber sole on the toe on one shoe and on the side of another.  Still bright white, showing just how little wear they have had.  Disappointing and not worth the price. Waste of money for sure.

I find this with most shoes so I usually expect it.  But the memory foam insoles that come in the shoes are plenty soft.  However for someone like me who has a high arch.  I had to remove the memory foam insoles and put in my own insoles that have support.Otherwise they are great shoes.

I usually wear trainers with leather or faux leather tops but they can be hard on my feet. The foam cushion of the Axelion feels good and wears light. I suspect that they will not prove to be as durable as the leather shoes. For walking on streets or social appearance, they seem fine.

I buy mostly Puma sneakers and I have many.  They are sleek and durable.  They are generally tighter than your average sneaker and some are tighter than the other.  I have this particular one Black-white and also have White-gray Violet and this one is not as comfortable and felt heavier as the other one.  Eventually, I got my small scale and weighed both of them.  The first one (Black-white) is 465 gram vs 437 gram for the second one (White-gray Violet). about 60 gram heavier.  Also, White-gray Violet  more comfortable and my feet feels cooler than the Black-white.

Honestly, bought a pair of these about 6 months ago and they're still holding up strong. I will 100% be ordering another pair when these wear out and from the way these are holding up, it'll be a while before I need to order another pair. I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone who is curious about how they are. They are Pumas. Quality, comfortable, and well made.  If you're even second guessing yourself, don't. Just buy them.

I wear size 11 shoes. I really love the concept with theses shoes. Design and color. When I tried them on, they were very comfortable. Only one problem. The memory foam insole didn't go all the way to the toe. So my toes clutched the edge of the memory foam like an eagle perched up in a tree. I got used to it but it wasn't as comfortable as it could be. Since i had worn them too much to return, I bought another pair. This time size 12. Perfect fit. Super comfortable. I can wear these all day and my feet don't hurt.

The soles are memory foam which was awesome to find out. Overall I’m very happy with my purchase and will be ordering more pairs in the near future.

Less than 8 months of minimal use and they are falling apart… Husband works from home and wore these occasionally as his “nice shoes”. Never used for exercise or vigorous activities. Bummed that I spent this much on a gift for them to last much less than his 15 dollar Walmart shoes.
"

A sleek looking shoe, especially for a wide. the width I thought was excellent. The airlift insoles feel great. The only downsides were the toe is a little boxy and wider then I would like and the first day I wore them, the lace strap snapped on the inside of the right shoe. I saw at least one other review where this happened. I contacted the seller (Amazon in my case) they are replacing the shoes with a new pair.

These shoes are not great at all. Zero toe support and the shoes in general are just not comfy.

Never again

I'm a 9 US in most shoes, and the 9 fit me pretty well. I got these after using up my Tazon's 6, and they fit pretty much the same. I bought these instead of the Tazon's because of the shoelace and mesh design. I use these to run and I haven't had an issue with them.

My delivery date for these shoes were August 16, 2021. Today's date is September 23, 2021. They have started to tear away where the rubber meets the fabric.  The stuff you see in the photo is shoe goo that I have used to put them back together. Everywhere you see the white/clear stuff is where I've had to glue it back together. For being Pumas you'd think their quality would be better. These shoes are only worn for 6 hours a day M-F. They aren't used as gum shoes or anything hing other than typical walking.

This is the second purchase for this shoe, and to be honest it won't be the last. I love the fit, look and feel of this shoe.

This is a minimalist-style shoe, with heel support. If you're into minimalist-style shoes, you might really like this shoe. If you're not, you'll hate it. It has pretty good heel support, but since it has absolutely zero support for the front half of your foot, the front part of your foot sits very close to the ground while your heel is up a half-inch, like high-heels. This awkward position makes your shins get worked really hard as you awkwardly walk around trying to keep your toes from up. It's probably something you'd get used to, but feels like it will cause shin splints initially.Toe box is also narrow; shoe is narrow, and the ""high heel"" effect further causes your foot to slide down and forward, pressing your toes towards the end of the shoe.Pros:Shoe looks nice. Feels like good quality. Will probably work well for you crazy lets-kill-our-joints cross-fit minimalist-shoe nuts.

These are not the same fit and feel as the Pumas they replaced. They are uncomfortable, tight and you can see the glue used form the soles.

The lacing setup provides excellent support for the whole foot, especially for someone who has narrow feet and/or high arches. Definetly on my buy-again list.
"
3686,"
Bought three pairs, correct size to my normal shoe size and have tried them for 6 weeks and the same issue with all of them... cannot get a comfortable fit from the ball of the foot forward; the foot slips/slides within the shoe causing the sock to wrinkle and discomfort if performing anything repetitive!They look great but no matter how many variations of tying the laces the same result.Exceedingly disappointed as I love the brand and the appearance but alas not the performance fit with this particular style. Looks like I will be having to find new shoes!

"

I purchased these shoes in April of this year. After wearing maybe 7 or 8 times the right shoe heel inside frayed out to the outside piece.  The left has been perfect.  After contacting the vendor about the defective shoe they hid behind the Amazon 30 day return policy.  This doesn’t seem right as far as a warranty on Puma shoes. Buyer beware is the takeaway.  Are these counterfeit?  I’ve had store bought last much longer
"
3712,"
Wrong size shoe in the box however; this style is my favorite and I am anticipating my exchange for the correct size. Super comfortable in the right size :-). Will order again as needed.

From my experience, Pumas tend to run on the small side. But other than that, they’re just as described.

Yep, they look great, but they are the most uncomfortable shoes I've worn in awhile. Initially when I tried these on in the store I was pleased with how they felt, but throwing them on to walk around downtown I was amazing how painful it was to move around in them. Don't be fooled by the initial feel of these shoes ... steer clear and avoid blisters.

First of all my shoes did not come in a original box. Then I noticed the color was not quite the same on each shoe then I checked the numbers in the tongue but the Puma logo on the back of the shoe is a different size than the other. That is what you get when see a deal to good to be true. It is!
"

Great fit as expected!
"
3835,"
It didn’t have air pockets under the shoe like the Airmax, heels is hard uncomfortable
"
3836,"
I really liked the style of the shoe. The biggest problem wasn’t the length of the shoe, it was true to size. The toe box was too small. It felt like the tops of my toes were very uncomfortable due to the height of the toe box.

I bought these for my man. He has wide feet and I know these shoes are narrow, so I bought a size larger. He has issues wearing shoes due nerve damage from a bad back surgery. Unfortunately he feels the pain in his foot and toes. He has tried several pairs of shoes and can only wear them for very short periods of time because they aggravate his foot. These can tolerate wearing for a longer period of time. I just recently ordered him his second pair.

I order Puma Men's Tazon shoes every winter for my hubby as a gift. He loves these shoes! We always order the Tazon line (different colors and styles of Tazon). After months of searching and trying over 25+ pairs of shoes, he finally found a style that works. We've been buying the Tazon line for 3 years now!The quality of this line is great. He wears them almost daily and they hold up well. The last pair after 9 months of wearing them (daily) the only wear we saw was inside the shoe where the back of his ankle hits. The support of the shoe after about a year of wearing them almost daily obviously isn't as good as before, but he always says they're still comfortable. Shoes for him are hard to find since most are uncomfortable for his feet and don't fit correctly. At one point a few years ago we'd tried over 25+ pairs of sneakers (various stores, brands, styles in the same brands, etc) and he couldn't wear any of them! We'd even tried other Pumas with no luck.It was so frustrating and extremely frustrating for him. You see, we'd been through this with dressier shoes as well, tried on a lot. He wanted to give up. Well I'd seen an add for the Puma Tazons and after about an hour of convincing him I got him to try them on. Typically he can tell if a shoe won't work for him the moment he tries them on or walks in them for less than ten seconds. I'd ordered his size and also half a size up. He put them on, walked around and from the look on his face I could tell they worked for him. I will say that he is always a 9, but for this shoe the 9 1/2 fit better for him, so you might want to try the half size up if your regular size doesn't feel right when you try them on. I love how the Tazon line has a bunch of styles and colors too! I've recommended this shoe to a lot of people and will continue to do.If I had my way I'd order a vast amount of colors and styles, but he isn't someone who likes to wear a bunch of different shoes. I did get two pairs this holiday season and told him he's going to alternate to change it up.Thank you Puma for making a good quality shoe that works well for my hubby.

I was looking for something comfortable for my son and I to do our daily walks in for Pokemon Go.  They were on sale for 29.99 and I figured why not.  The memory foam mentioned in the product description is way under rated.  It really wonderful and absorbs so much impact compared to my last pair which were thick soled New Balance.  I'm in the high 200s, so that's significant when talked about cushioning the bottom of the foot.  Saw a few people talked about tight in the toe.  If you just slip them on and lace them up that will definitely be a thing.  I relaced them a bit more to my comfort level and they're just fine.  I think the pre-lacing on these is for the maximum snug fit.  All in all, super impressed with these and thinking of buying another pair or 2 for backup while they're cheap.
"

I liked this shoe a lot and the price was right. These shoes were a half size too large for me. I need a snug fitting shoe. They felt great and premium to the touch. The color was very nice. The footbed was comfortable enough to wear all day. There was plenty of traction and grip. I did return these and would have gladly exchanged for a half size smaller but at the time they did not have the size I needed. I will probably give these shoes another whirl next time if the babe my size.

I walk 40 minutes every morning on a combination of sidewalks and well-maintained dirt trails.  I've had these shoes for a week, and had I not put 30+ miles on them, I'd send them back.  The insole is supposed to be ""soft foam for ultimate comfort.,"" and to the touch it is.  However, it compresses to virtually nothing.  With each step I can feel the tread design on the sole, and if I step on a a rock, I can feel it as well.  Needless to say, they make my feet ache.  Not only that, for some curious reason my calves also ache after walking in them. I don't know if its the way they are designed or the way I tend to walk.  Regardless, my feet kick and scream in rebellion when I put them on!That's the negative side.  On the plus side, they fit as expected.  They are definitely light and don't have clunky soles, so they are easy to walk in.  And, I like the graphics!For me, they aren't the best shoe.  If you buy them, I'd suggest you try them out on the type surface you're going to be walking/running on.  I didn't.  I tried them on a carpet in my house and they seemed fine.  Good luck.

I had 2 other pair of puma that were twice as expensive. They fit better and have way better build quality and support. I just assumed these would be the same but honestly they feel like you're wearing fake shoes. There's no structure to them and when you walk they feel like they're just kind of end-pieces around your feet, but definitely not any kind of shoe designed for actual athletic support in any way. The color is uniform and black which is fine, but honestly I regret buying these

"

As other reviewers have stated, these shoes run 1/2 size small.  The toe box is narrow, and the length is shorter than Nike athletic shoes.  Order 1/2 size larger than your regular street shoe size, and you should be fine.  The materials feel a bit cheap, compared to higher end athletic shoes (I.e. synthetic materials and very poor orthotic support).  I would not run in these, or use them for weight training due to stability issues.  I wear these shoes with jeans, for casual events that require limited walking.  The insoles are padded with foam inserts, but they are far less comfortable than most running shoes.  I’m not expecting these shoes to hold up under extreme training conditions, so I will use them for running errands, social gatherings, etc.  Worth the reasonable price for the style/look, but not the most robust athletic shoe for serious workouts.

This was going to get a 1 star when I first got these but I decided to wait a little longer to write the review.

I wasn't expecting the time it took to break them in to be so long but now I enjoy wearing them because I am on my feet all day and I desperately need some comfortable shoes. The price wasn't terrible when I was looking for a new pair and I have had people recommend this brand. Probably won't buy them again when they wear out but I'm glad I didn't spend a lot for them.

I ordered these mostly because I thought they looked cool. Didn’t read any reviews and honestly, my previous experience with Puma goes back to the 1980s.I ordered a 9 1/2 because that is my normal size. 43 in European sizes. The Euro size on the box is a 42 1/2. Looks like I’ll have to send these back and exchange them for a pair of 10s.Other than how tight the toe box is on my big toe, these shoes seem quite well put together and the insole is super soft & comfy. Still really like how they look too. Will update later if I’m able to exchange them for the bigger size.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE!!! I'm a mail carrier and these are the most comfortable sneakers I've had in a while. I usually have to replace the inserts but w/these I feel like I'm walking on air. Before I bought these I read the reviews where they've fallen apart or the tongue separated from the sneaker. I bought them on May 21st & check them everyday, and I don't see anything yet. I ordered another pair that's being delivered tomorrow so that I have another pair waiting in the wings. GO PUMA!!!!10/23/22-SOOOO I found a flaw in both pairs. They tore at the same spot on the right foot. I was wearing them both 5-6 days a week, 8-10 hours/day, for almost 6 months. But guess what? My new pair came yesterday😁. This might be my last pair for work. I already see a women's pair that I'm definitely getting.

BLUF: The soft, comfortable insides of Pumas are the main reason for my switch and stick with Pumas.I remember when I was younger and much poorer than I am now, every once in a while my dad would take me to go get some fresh pair of Jordans because those were his favorites (If nothing else, he made sure we at least had good fit shoes). Growing fast and having big feet, I would always need new shoes. So I would go with it until, one time, we couldn't find a fit for me. That's when accidentally came across the superfine pair of Pumas, the most comfortable pair of shoes I had ever decided to put my feet into. Needless to say, since then Pumas became my shoe-of-choice ever since then. Even now that I make my own paycheck, I still have trouble getting shoes because I have pretty wide feet. I've bout other shoes and other brands, but they don't always have a Wide Sized pair of 14s you know? (I get tired of going in-store and them not having my size or even buying shoes online just for them not to be wide enough for my feet). So, yes. Both I and my feet have been happy, despite my dad's disappointment.

I have to say I was weary of buying this show since there's not a lot of sole, but it has been heaven so far. The innersoles feel thin but amazing and enough. I love how they look.

The toe box is very tight. I have a broad ball of the foot and run to a wide fit with a narrow heel. So, fit for me is difficult. The material is very sturdy and doesn't lend itself to stretch. Other Puma footwear has accommodated this. Good for a workout, but I can't imagine a full day of wear. I would need a wider toe or maybe go up a size. Like the shoe, but be cautious on the sizing. Not sized for American men.

These shoes are very nice for the price. They are comfortable and supportive, and at first look great too.

I love the sleek look and feel of these sneakers. They have good support and tighten up to fit narrow feet. The dull black pleather on the top is great for resisting dirt and smudges. This is my second pair; will keep buying.
"
4236,"
For the price, they are a great looking, great fitting pair of shoes.  Comfortable, just the right amount of snug, and the weight feels good.  Hard to beat the value for the price, and the looks are second to none IMO.The reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is that I bought them to use a a cross trainer.  The soft sole (very similar to memory foam) is quite comfortable for daily wear, but it is not a great option for an actual trainer.  Too much give leads to variable performance during running and training, especially resistance training or crossfit style training where a sturdy base is imperative.  Also, the outer material that offers outstanding appearance is not breathable compared to alternatives.Ultimately, it is a great looking and comfortable daily wear sneaker, with a neutral color that wears well with most anything.  I just do not use it for any planned exercise activity.
"
4237,"
They fit as expected. Really comfortable, light. I'm using these to go out to the store, go for leisure walks. I'm not sure how they will handle running or any other sports. This is my 3rd pair of pumas and I am actually loving them. They are affordable compared to other brands!
"

Summary: This is an adequate casual sneaker that fits well. However, this shoe didn't hold up under prolonged activity nor did it hold up after changing the insoles.One day, I took my lunchtime three mile walk in these shoes. The ball of my right foot started feeling friction burn about two miles in, so I curled my toes in to compensate for the final mile. That caused heel pain that is ongoing a month later despite rest and change in footwear. I'll concede this was self-inflicted for improperly compensating.Then, I changed out the insoles hoping for more comfort and support, but it feels like walking directly on concrete despite the pair of insoles I used. That said, the memory foam insoles that come with these shoes do suffice (minus the friction burn I'd get). I've taken my lunchtime walk while wearing Sketchers Outdoor memory foam shoes many times and never had this issue.This has been an extremely frustrating experience, but these shoes had sufficed under everyday, low-activity situations.
"
4239,"
These are great shoes, and very comfortable, but, as a normal size 9.5 on a regular, these were very tight. I had to exchange for a 10W to have a better fit. The shoe size runs small, so add a .5 or full size, and wider if applicable...
"

"
4241,"
I am not a runner, but I tend to find 'running' shoes to be the most comfortable type for everyday wear. I went with this shoe for both the price, and the classic look.It is borderline between being true to fit and running small. I wear anywhere from a normal width 11.5 to a 12 wide depending on the brand. Ordered the 12 here. it fits very snug, but not cramped. I went for a short jog in them and there was no pain or otherwise discomfort from the fit. In a perfect world, the toe box would be a quarter inch wider for me.Unlike most of today's running shoes, this has a harder rubber sole instead of the very soft, pliable rubber. over the long haul, I would suspect that long distance running would wind up being less comfortable. For me this is a walking around shoe though, so that won't be a problem. The inside padding is different from what I have seen in other brands, kind of a very firm memory foam rather than a gel liner. Feels comfortable enough so far.All in all, pretty happy with the purchase and will be keeping them.

so i bought these thinking they look cool, i want to transition to a new brand and this was my new go to for shoes, shirts, and so on. well one year later they are tearing.....never ran in them, hardly walked in them, and never used for work. I guess on the left side i also developed a hole....i cant blame the shoes on that one, but i can say they are thin. the sole is tearing from the toe box and idk why. if you buy, just be cautious.

I was a bit skeptical about purchasing shoes online, but I was certain of my foot size, so I decided to go for it anyway. I’ve never been to a store that sells quality shoes, so purchasing them online seemed convenient. I’m sure glad I bought them.Before these, I was wearing another rather expensive pair of shoes (probably overpriced) that I bought at a mall. They were $70—the most I’ve spent on a pair of shoes. I liked them, but they provide zero traction and zero support. Basically, they’re good for showing off, even though they’re not flashy in the least bit. I walk a lot, so I need shoes that are comfortable to wear, and in these harsh Minnesota winters they need traction as well.I searched for shoes on Amazon and these Puma shoes came up. They look nice, feature my favorite color scheme (black, white, and red), and they’re actual tennis shoes. You know, the shoes that are supposed to be comfortable. Well, these shoes are comfortable. I don’t even think I’ll need to swap the insoles (I tried removing them, but they didn’t seem to budge. Maybe I need more force) because the ones they ship with are comfortable enough. Standing on my feet for six hours, I can say I noticed a significant reduction in sore footedness, if that’s a word.I plan to make these my daily drivers, and I imagine they’ll hold up for at least a few years. I’ll just need to be sure to clean them every once in a while, so they maintain their whiteness.

All I know is that this shoe fits my feet perfectly. Don't ask me about sizes or whatever. Numbers never mean anything to me, because from one brand to another, or one style to another, etc etc everything is different. I really don't appreciate it either.This shoe looks like it'd hurt your feet due to the thin sole and not much support, at least I think. That's pretty wrong though. I've worn these all day, even sweating all day. I've never had any pain at all. No fatigue, nothing. I've walked in water and rain and hours with soaked feet. Been out on blacked pavement in the worst heat for hours. Walked and ran over about every kind of terrain, hey comfortable shoes are hard to find. Very hard to find. I'll wear them no matter what. I even wore them when I spent a week in the woods building training shelters for missionaries. I'm not saying they came back looking new, but they didn't have any wear and my feets were nice and comfy. That's why I got 3 of them.

My foot size is 9.5. If I buy Nike, it's 9.5. If I buy Adidas, it's 9.5. So I also bought 9.5 Puma. And the f did I get. I got huge-ass shoes. Too big. Feet is sliding. I returned these huge-ass 9.5 Puma shoes and get size 9. Now my feet fits. So a recommendation for you - get a half-a-size smaller shoes cause Puma doesn't know foot sizes. Otherwise good shoes. Looks cool and feels good. (Also, don't put you pee-pee in the shoe.)

Based on a lot of the reviews as well as Puma's typically running narrower, I ordered a 12 instead of my usually 11.5.  The width was good, but the 12 was definitely too long.  They seem like a decent, casual shoe, but probably won't hold up for lots of walking/moving around.  I may get an 11.5 just to have as an extra pair to wear with khakis to work.

I bought this shoe August 10, 2020 for my son (20) who goes out of the house 2 times a week.  Where he walks out of the house to sits in a car and walks into a building then sits for 3 hours to turn around and come home. So their maybe on his feet 7 hours a week.  About 2 1/2 months after purchase he went to put them on and the tongue came out of one shoe.  I contacted Amazon and because it was past the 30 day return window they gave me Puma's email address to deal with them directly.  After 5 days, 6 emails and 2 phone calls it has come to a full circle where they are not responsible either. By the way contacting them gives you another BS run around.  With the first two back and fourth emails I sent them the amazon receipt with pictures of the shoe and a detailed description of what was needed.  They emailed me not once but, twice saying they weren't responsible for lost or damaged products coming from a different retailer. (I take ""damage"" meaning in the mail ect. Not manufacturing related where the tongue wasn't sewed in right).  Being I didn't purchase them directly from Puma.com.  So with that said I am now out $54.99 and have a brand new pair of shoes with no warranty on the quality make of these shoes.  Sadly when I bought these I still believed PUMA was a well made higher quality shoe.  So BUYERS BEWARE they look nice, wear nice until they don't.  Then no one is responsible for the manufactures error of quality control.  I am still shocked that AMAZON WON'T HELP EITHER.  STARTING TO WONDER IF THEY ARE GETTING TO BIG FOR THEIR OWN BRITCHES.

This shoe was kind of a let down after wearing my Nike Winflo 5’s almost every day. I bought these for a decent shoe to wear around the warehouse that I wouldn’t worry about beating up on. They do meet that description, but they definitely don’t have the bounce or support of my old nikes. I’ve actually switched back to my tattered nikes because I had started having some pains after wearing the pumas. (I probably walk about 8mi per day at work). I use them now as just some basic kick around shoes for when it’s raining and I need something I don’t care about getting dirty. Hoping that they just last longer than some Walmart shoes.

This is a 6-month review:I purchased these for a couple of different cross-training programs. One focused on weight training, while the other involved a lot of speed, agility, and sweat! After about 4-6 months, the outside is still very much intact: The sole is still tight to the outsole, there is no wear & tear on the upper, and the fit is still just right (no real stretching). The padding in the heel has worn away significantly on both shoes. This is nothing an extra pair of socks can't handle, but this is...well, I guess you could call it this shoe's Achilles heel, both literally and figuratively.

Like the shoes. They look good when you get them. I like how they have the outside sole built into shoe design, so the bottom looks slimmer and sleeker profile. Fit as expected. What I found I like less is that they come across as a bit bulky. Inadvertently and unintentionally, my previous sneakers all have mesh tops, which lets them hug the foot more. That gives them all a smaller profile around my foot, which I came to like unknowingly. These, being of thicker material, will have a boxier and fuller look. That's fine; just making aware.

I've taken them on my mountain bike with very studded pedals & with minimal tears the to bottoms of them. The grip is great on all surfaces. They don't leave any scuffs marks on floors nor squeak after becoming wet. They can get dirty & be cleaned back to new with just a wipe. They don't really attract dirt so they are very easy to clean. Very comfortable & breathe great as well. They are light sneakers so long time spent on them bears no pain. The fit is very comfortable I have more of a  flat foot & they do not have a high arches that bother me. People with wide feet may even be able to wear these. One of my favorite cheaper sneakers for all around use. They are very abrasion resistant.

I believe it was in the 90s when i started buying Suede Puma's of all different colors, always found their looks and comfort never let me down, came across these cross trainers tazon 6, Fracture FM Puma, its usually hard for me to find my size inn discounted shoes, pleasantly surprised to find these in my size, shoes look great all black on black and the fit is as i expected firm but comfortable to walk in, would highly recommend them, fine print told me they were synthetic leather, the touch and feel remind enough of leather it wasnt a big deal, for the price they cant be beat and look fantastic

well I originally purchased the 12 regular and it was very tight around the outside of my foot.  I sent it back and ordered the double wide and they fit like a dream.  It feels like I am walking on clouds.  I am not sure why I did not purchase these sooner!  They are amazing.  I usually have inserts in the shoe as the soles of the shoes that I wear do not have enough cushion or support.  However these shoes are so comfortable that I did not put in the inserts as it has memory foam.  I have been wearing them for a few weeks now and they are fully worn in.  They are still the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on my foot.  They do not have much of a sole.  They are much thinner than the other shoes (Nike) that I have worn in the past. However, they are still so very comfortable.  Also they do not breath that well so I am not sure how I am going to like them in the middle of summer, but for now they are extremely comfortable.  Lastly, they do clean up well.  I have scuffed them up on shopping carts, kids stepping on my feet, etc.  A wet rag and they clean right up.

My Puma sneakers arrived yesterday. I have not worn them outside yet. What caught my attention was the style of the sneaker. The sneaker modestly stands out with its multi dimensional features on the external inner & out sides. The sneaker size may need to be ordered a half size (the first pair ordered was my actual shoe size & they were returned) larger than your shoe size.  My pair is the narrow & fits like a glove with tube socks.  It’s a comfortable fit light weight sneaker. I’ll make an effort to post another review after wearing them for more than ten hours. I’m hoping the sneaker will continue to perform exceptionally.

The sneaker looks great.  The problem is that it's tight at the toes.  Bought for my son who is 14.  He does not have particularly wide feet at all.  In fact he only weighs abouy 100 pounds.  Because they looked so nice, I was disappointed and not ready to give up.  I stuffed a lot of newspaper into the front of the shoe to try and stretch out the toe area.  This seems to be helping and my son has been able to wear the shoes.  However, as another reviewer mentioned, there is a crease that is already developing on the top of the shoe that goes around to the side.  :-(  Again, I love the way these shoes look, and after stretching them out my son says they are okay.  But really they need to make these with a bit more toe room.UPDATE:  So after wearing them a few days they have stretched out and my son says they are comfortable now.  I have revised from  to 4 stars.

I’ve bought the same style of sneakers 3 times and I love them, they're very comfortable and a great fit but they have all had the same issue after a week or 2 of running in them. They get a hole inside both shoes, right at the top of the heel, doesn’t go all the way through, but it goes through all of the cushioning. I usually have to add some moleskin inside otherwise it gives me terrible blisters on my heels.As I said, I love the sneakers, it’s why I’ve ordered them 3 times through Amazon, but potential buyers should know about this potential defect.

These are great everyday shoes, but I had to replace the insole to get some arch support.  The insole that comes with the shoe is flat as can be and is about 4mm thick...if that.  I'm not sure if I just have high arches or not, but there was nothing in there for support and they got painful quick.  A quick swap of insoles fixed that, and I can go 13+ hours a day with these shoes.

Wow what a great price for these sneakers!  My husband has been buying Puma sneakers for his last 3 or 4 sneaker purchases.  He really like the comfort and support Puma gives him.  I would say his sneakers get heavy use too between the gym and almost daily walking of at least 2 miles.  The Puma sneaker hugs your foot and gives it plenty of support without being too tight.  They are comfortable right out of the box with little needed break in time.  The cushioning and arch support are great.  He has had problems in the past finding sneakers that give him good cushioning and support so now that he has discovered Puma does, he has purchased several pairs of this brand.  Even though the price was low on this pair, there is no sacrifice in quality.I saw other reviews say they run small.  He got his normal size and they fit perfectly.  The quality of the material is very good.  He really likes the colors on this black and silver color scheme.  They will look good with not only gym shorts but also jeans.

I'm not really a runner. Most of my footwear are either hiking boots/sneakers (like Merrell's) or Work boots / Cowboy boots. I got these to start jogging in. For that they are pretty great. Only once after I just started jogging I had gotten some bloody toes right around my toenail but I think that was due to the fact that I'm not used to that type of exercise and a two mile jog might have been a little more that I should have started with. But that hasn't happened since.My only real complaint about these shoes are the shoe laces that come with them. They were way too small. I couldn't use all of the eyelets with the supplied laces. Leaving the last two open. I ended up needing to use laces closer to 55 Inches.I would recommend this shoe, but just keep note that you may need to buy new (longer) laces.

I know I have large feet, I wear a size 14 in most every shoe other than sandals. After I received these shoes as soon as I pulled them out of the box I noticed how narrow the shoes were but went ahead and tried them on. After putting these shoes on and walking around the house a little the toe box was already pinching my big toe and pinky toe and I knew if I tried walking any distance in these my feet would be extreamly sore.There is also little to no arch support but I didn't really buy these shoes expecting that to be good, though there really would not have been room for insoles and my feet in these shoes.

These are pretty comfy as long as you won’t be on your feet on concrete floors for 8+ hours. I bought these for my nursing clinicals and my feet hurt terribly by the end of my 12 hour shift.

I am very pleased with these shoes. Amazingly comfortable with the puma soft foam they're one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I've ever had and they look very nice. Pictures are after they've been worn for about 2 weeks, they have held up very nicely and I didn't even wipe them off for the pics. For the price this is just fantastic. All pumas run a little small so they might feel tight when you first put them on but they stretch right back out. Like I said they're probably the most comfortable shoes I own and the material makes them pretty durable but slightly vulnerable to scratches and scuffs. But overall I have to give these a five star review

Cheap material, I've worn them 3 days at work and they now look warped and damaged with a small crack forming on the outer layer of one of the shoes.  I walk maybe 15k steps a day at work as it's mostly desk work. Definitely not running shoes. Was expecting better from Puma. Idk.

I actually got these originally from another website because of the reviews - everyone said they were so comfortable.  After going through his 1st pair in about 3 months, I bought them through Amazon... a LOT cheaper than the original site.  My partner works in an auto shop, so he's standing/walking all day, from 7am to 5:30pm.  He has very large (13!), very flat feet.  So these not only cushion, but support his feet all day long, and they don't slip.  The cushioned sole helps bounce you, and there's less wear on your knees.  I had bought the wide ones originally, but it turns out those weren't good for him, and the normal width ones are actually more comfortable for him.  Now that he's on his 2nd pair, he's a lifelong user.

These shoes look great on me, and the soles are comfortable.  But after just a few weeks of wearing these to the gym I’m tossing them and buying better gym shoes.  The tongues don’t have a place to run the shoestrings through and thus they slip down uncomfortably.  Also, at the back of the shoe a metal strap inside the material sometimes moves out of place when putting the shoes on.  Overall, these shoes are a pain in the foot.

Seriously - DO NOT BUY THESE!!! I don't know who put the Puma logo on these cheap pieces of junk, but if Puma ever found out, I am sure there would be a lawsuit involved very quickly.  I have used Puma shoes for my whole life, and these are NOT PUMA SHOES!  The insole is completely different from what they use, the ""arch support"" is a cheap piece of plastic on the outside of the sole under the shoe, which does ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD FOR SUPPORT OF THE FOOT!  As for the fit, they were too long, and I have worn the same size shoe since I was 14, so I know that I need a 7 1/2, and these fit more like an 8 1/2.  The sole of the shoe has absolutely no support for any form of use in these shoes, not to mention that the ""synthetic material"" they are made of is so cheaply made, the shoes are cracked after only 6 hours of use.  I WILL NOT be purchasing ANY OTHER products from this particular site, and will be notifying the manufacturer of the known issues with this pair of cheap, imitation knock-off, pieces of junk.  Shame on Amazon for letting people sell junk like this on their website.

I love everything about this shoe- I’ve gotten several different colors/types.It definitely is a bit snug, so if you want to put any insoles in it make sure to get a slightly larger size.

Had these about a week now. They're a bit ""snug"" in fit but not small.. more like a soccer cleat fit where they're snug on the foot for a good fit. My foot doesn't slide within them for sure.Looks are sharp (I got them in the black version), and the soles are very comfortable. Granted I'm coming off of about 2 year old Reeboks that were like work horses and are worn to death (but they just now truly came apart). Treads on these are nice and open so a bit easier to clean out if you do get mud or what not in them, which is a huge benefit for me for those times I sneak in the house with my shoes still on.Overall I like them.

If you work a lot on your feet with these on, they will begin to feel uncomfortable.

These shoes look fantastic. That's about the only positive thing I can say about them.Great looks, cheap feeling material and construction.The top and sides look and feel like cheap vinyl. The bottom feels like you're walking on a piece of semi flexible plastic (sounds like ot too).  I wore these shoes to work Friday, and then out for a bit of shopping after work. My feet felt about like I'd put in a 12 hour factory production floor shift in the cheapest Walmart steel toe boots. However, I have an office job and only had to walk across the warehouse one time that day.So, that's 8 hours in an office job, with one walk around the warehouse, a couple of hours of walking at Best Buy and Hobby Lobby and my feet hurt soooo much by the time I got home.IDK, maybe these shoes just aren't made for heavyweights. Maybe it would be a better experience for featherweights.I got them on sale for $35, but I think I would have been better off getting those cheap, tacky basic shoes at Walmart for $20. I wish I could refund, but it's too late now.

The shoe over all is pretty good. The only thing I don’t really like about it is that there is no loop for the laces in the tongue. I don’t know about anyone else, but when I wear shoes for more than just a little while, the tongue always slides off to the side of my foot so that the laces are against my socks…It’s a decent shoe if that’s not a problem for you. And if the shoe was made with a loop in the tongue for laces to hold the tongue in place, then that would’ve been great.

I wear a size 12 in basically every brand of shoes. The two exceptions being Converse and Toms. 11 and a half are perfect there. My foot is wider than average, but I’ve never had to order a wide shoe size. These Pumas are quality shoes, but narrow and short for a size 12. Very tight fit. Order a half size over your usual and wide option if you have wider feet! Otherwise fantastic shoes.

The shoe looks great, fits great, and is pretty much perfect. The only complaint I have is that the memory foam insole is not that comfortable. I actually prefer the ""normal""  insole in my other two pairs of Pumas. They just feel better on my feet. While these shoes aren't horrible shoes, and I do recommend buying them for style and looks alone. I just don't find them to be very comfortable over a long day of wearing them. In my honest opinion, buy them if you like them. I just wouldn't wear them for more than 4 to 6 hours at a time.

I work a retail job where I am on my feet for 8-10 hours a day on hard floors.  I have tried many brands and styles of sneakers/walking shoes at many price points from $20-150.  Usually they are either very comfortable for a short time but degrade quickly, or they are durable but uncomfortable causing foot/leg/back pain, etc.  This pair, however, has been outstanding!  Great support, comfort, durability, and style all rolled into one pair of shoes.  I now know what brand I will be looking for when I need my NEXT pair of work shoes.  Highly recommended!

My husband wears a size 14 shoe and he says that they fit nice. His feet do not look practical joke huge in them either. This is nice shoe that can be dressed up or down. The toe box looks narrow but according to my hubby they fit his toe box area just fine. These, in his opinion, are out on the town stylin shoes. Some could use them for running. He is receiving so many compliments on His new kicks!

I loved the shoes! It looks as describes. I bought them for my 11year old son but he complained it was tight at the width for him; seeing as how he would be the one wearing them almost daily, I decided to return them. And he complained that he thought they felt like they had a higher than usual heel (he's taller than most kids in his class, so maybe that's why)??? So I had to go looking again. Found another PUMA at a local store, same price but not as nice-looking as these.

My husband loves his PUMA sneakers.  He is very active and on his feet a lot throughout the day.  He wears these for the gym and for walking.  They are very comfortable and have great support.  The arch support is very good.  This is his second or third pair of PUMA sneakers and he has found them to be the most comfortable and also well made.  The materials are excellent quality and they hold up to wear and tear very well.  He has had one pair for 5 months and they still look almost new and are providing great support even after much use.  He has tried other brands but his feet get sore in them.  These also have a nice cushioned heel.  He seems to walk very hard on his heels and has heel pain if he doesn't have good shoes.  He got them in the white with gray/silver accents and they are very nice looking.  I would highly recommend these!

Without going into crazy detail, these shoes, for me, are arguably the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn of this particular style. The insert that comes with the shoes is amazing.. I usually wear Nike, have had Adidas, New Balence, Asics, etc. and I prefer these over all of those. I'll be getting another pair of these soon in a different color.

I have a normal width foot.  Width seems ok, but tight vertically.  I'm wondering if the wide model would be more comfortable.  I expect they will stretch a little and break in.  First time I've ordered shoes online.  I usually go to sporting goods store and try them on first.  I probably would have noticed and tried the W model had I tried them on first.

This is a great looking casual shoe. The fit is snug on my feet, but comfortable. I usually wear a women's 11. The 9.5 mens size is a perfect fit. Good for light exercise.

These shoes are nicely priced, fairly comfortable and sharp looking. This is my 2nd pair of Pumas and I'm beginning to figure out that Pumas fit small, so take my advice: If you wear a size10.5 US (like me), get 11's (or 1/2 size larger). And if you have wider feet, definitely purchase the wide size, if available. They seem to be a tad skinny in the width department.After this, all-in-all, I'm happy I bought these!🙂👍

As soon as I saw these shoes, I fell in love with them! The white and red combination looks absolutely beautiful and as soon as I got them, I had to put them on. The smooth texture all around the shoe gave me the assurance that this was a high quality shoe. These shoes are very comfortable, and I honestly love to wear them. They have a sole that is cushioned, so it feels like your stepping on something really soft. The sleek design and comfortable use made me very jubilant. I still have these shoes, and I still love them. I do wish that the ventilation on the shoes were better. The small holes that it has on the front of the shoe don't really provide a lot of air flow into your feet and could make your feet smell. If I go for a long walk, my feet will usually smell, but overall I'm really satisfied with this product and give it a 5 star rating!

I bought these just over 2 months ago to wear predominantly at work because I’m on my feet 8-12 hours per day. I deal with recurring plantar fasciitis, but haven’t had a significant flare up since I purchased these shoes. After a 2 month test run they are still very comfortable, provide great support, and allow decent airflow. I would’ve given 5 stars, but when I opened the box the first thing I noticed was a very pronounced purple hue on the shoes and laces that was no where near as obvious in the product image pic. I know that  periscope has hints of purple, but I was expecting  a much deeper shade of gray based on the picture.

I wear Pumas all of the time. The last two of these have issues with the tongues not staying in place. Thought it was a fluke last time and cut a hole in the tongue.

I like the look of this shoe but would not recommend it for training or tennis.  I will keep my pair though for casual wear. The memory foam insole is very comfortable and the shoe itself has a very clean look to it.  However, I was looking for a tennis shoe but after one match I knew these would not do. The leather is soft and doesn’t offer much support. The sole seems good and grippy though.  My toes took a beating though and for this reason I will not use these shoes on the court. I’ll look for a more robust cross trainer type shoe with more support.

These run small and are somewhat on the narrow side. I purchased my usual size 10 D and they fit like a 9.5 and very tight with wearing crew socks. I suggest sizing up at least a 1/2 size if not a full size larger if you plan to wear crew socks with these shoes. These also have a lower then average heel height. Please keep this in mind if you require arch support. These however are sharp looking sneeks.3/25/16 Update. As stated above, the Tazon 6 style sizing tends to narrow and small. I purchased another pair of Tazon 6 elsewhere in a size 11 and the size 11 fit perfectly and are quite comfortable. So my suggestion guy's, is ordering one size larger in this particular puma Tazon 6 style running shoe.

Fit well and are well made. I have had previous model of this shoe and liked them. I bought these and they are everything I expected. Comfortable and well made.

Great looking shoe. Does show dirt and scuff marks because of color. I have the Tazon 6 cross trainer in gray and it is a great shoe and great fit (size 10 1/2). I normally like wearing a size 10 but ordered a half size larger due to a review.  The Tazon 6 running shoe seems to be slightly wider. If I ordered again, I would stick to a size 10 with the  running shoe. Length is great.

Absolutely love these!!!!!! I get so many compliments!! The design is even better in person! They fit like pumas. If you've never worn pumas before I would suggest you going to a shoe store that sells them and try them on. Pumas fit differently. I'm normally an 8-8.5 in women's, but in pumas I'm an 8 in men's because they are tighter. They are a sports shoe, so that's how they're going to fit.

When I first put these on, I thought they were far too tight.  I don't know if maybe they tightened up too much with the chemical drying bags or what, but I thought I would have to return them.  However, after the first day, they loosened up and became quite comfortable.  In fact, they're one of the best pair of shoes I've ever owned (on par with Doc Martins).  The only downside is that the pair I ordered were all black, and mostly leather, so I wouldn't recommend them for hot days.

I got these because my other shoes were on their last legs and was thinking it would be cool to have a pair of trainers. That was until I got them, they fit but they can not handle water at all. I wore them to work and the moment they hit a slick surface they lost all traction with the floor. I was able to put my butt against a wooden door the weight of the door slid me from one side of the door frame all the way to the other. After a 4 or 5 hour shift my feet began to get just as sore in these shoes, as they do in my regular 30 dollar Walmart shoes.

Purchasing over internet, buyer beware!Without having a ‘dry fit’, using international sizing, these were tight width. I’m actually borderline Wide. To tight to be comfortable even for short periods of time.
"
4535,"
First off, these were a true fit for me. I normally wear size men 10.5 in Reebok/Asics and these fit great, they are almost a perfect fit. They did take a couple hours to break in but the SoftFoam padding feels good on the feet. It's been a couple years since I've owned a pair of Puma's, mainly because of the price so I was happy to get these for $40. A con for these shoes would be the width for some people, I would say that my feet are a standard width but I always had to wear wides when I wore Nike's but I no longer like their style of shoes.Hopefully this helps someone.

I'm one of those people who likes to see how long a pair of shoes can last. And by last, I mean, how long until I literally can't walk with them anymore because they are either completely torn up or the soles are totally gone. Turns out, this is a horrible idea! Bad shoes = bad posture and bad back.I purchased these shoes because my last pair were Pumas and they lasted many years. The fit was great, and compared to incredibly old shoes it's like walking on clouds. If people could walk on clouds, that is. I'm sure they are soft. What I'm trying to say is that these shoes are awesome and they are comfortable. Great for walking, running, jumping, and swimming (just kidding, do not swim in them, just making sure you're paying attention). Great shoes!

Great shoe for walking and everyday use. The gel insert is very comfortable which makes up for the stiffness. I purchased these shoes a few years ago as a running shoe but immediately switched them to my everyday shoe. Definitely worth the price for well built, sturdy shoe. These pumas were advertised as a running shoe but don’t expect to run much in these, they are to heavy, bulky and stiff to use as a running shoe and may cause pain or injury but again, they are a very good walking shoe, that are very well put together unlike many Running shoes that will stretch or fall apart when they get wet.

These were bought to replace my Salomon hiking shoes that I had been my go too hiking shoe.

My son absolutely loves these shoes. The shoe is more narrow than most other brands which is perfect for his narrow foot. The toe box is roomy but not too big. The support for a high arch is a little lacking but inserts correct that problem. The cushion support is comfortable and sturdy. The look of the shoe is sharp and athletic looking. He gets lots of compliments on them. Hopefully they wear as well as they look and feel.

Bought this shoe to use as a cross trainer. They don't have a lot of support. Felt like I had to tie them overly tight to keep my foot from moving around and even then, they weren't great. There isn't enough cushion along the whole sole. They only felt like the was real cushion around the heel. They look good, so I'll probably keep them for basic walking shoes, but definitely won't use them for working out or running.

Shoes are very comfortable compared to Nike.The leather is much softer and flexible. I typically wear a 12 in Nike, but since some of the reviews said that these run a tad small, I ordered on full size up to a 13.The fit in the 13 for me is correct.  I would recommend these shoes.

I bought these for work as I have an arch issue and I cannot wear my normal boots or flats.

I bought my usual shoe size and they fit like a glove, though maybe I've just got wide feet, but these shoes are just a tiny bit tight on the sides, though as I wear them more often maybe they'll stretch a little to fit.Overall, they're comfortable, light, and the material seems to be quality stuff, so I'm definitely happy with my purchase though I got them half-off so maybe wait for them to be on sale because I think the normal price is a little steep for my wallet personally.

Bought these for weightlifting in my gym at the fire station. I wanted a pair of black neutral shoes, so the looks and styling is ok. I had been looking at them for a while, but when my cousin's husband had a similar pair at Christmas, and he loves his, I felt like it was a sign.These are heavy and stiff. If I plan on doing any serious cardio at the gym, I wear a different pair of shoes. If I wear these to workout and wear them the rest of the day, my feet are hurting by the evening. Let me stress, these shoes are not pliable. They would not be comfortable for running. I'm not a professional runner or even an avid runner, I'm not partial to running, but I've done my fair share of running for exercise.Would I buy these again? No. I prefer another brand and I'll go back to them from now on. I wouldn't even recommend these for regular use.

Decided to try men's style when I saw the price of men's Taxon is HALF the price of the women's.  I'm a woman and have had 2 pairs of women's Tazon previously. It's almost exactly the same. I'd say the men's are actually a tad more comfortable. More cushioning and roomy in heel.

Feel more like clunky cross trainers than running shoes.Also, they look cool with the cat and all (that's why I bought them) but certain things like the tongue kind of folds weird when you lace it up.

I hate shopping for shoes but when I find a pair that I like I stick with them.  After finding my first pair of Puma shoes in a big box store and wearing them out I decided to see if Amazon carried them and am very happy that they do.  The price was actually a couple bucks less than the big box store and the shoes are identical in every way.  If your looking for a good fitting and nice looking pair of shoes to run around town in - look no further.

These shoes look and feel amazing. The inserts are very soft and are great for my feet as standing on my feet causes me pain if done for extended periods of time. With these shoes on, I have no problems and my feet never feel worn out. Easily one of the best shoes I've ordered. I knocked one star off because I accidentally bumped the corner of a wall leaving a room in my house and that small bump put a dent in the front of my left shoe. I didn't expect a shoe to take damage the first time something happens to them...especially after one nick.

I've had these for about 5 months now and they work great! The cushioning works well for me and I work in a factory with concrete floors. I sometimes put them on when I'm in the house and need some cushion while in the kitchen for a lot of hours at a time. I'm a female but have giant feet and have to buy men's shoes. As my second pair of Pumas these worked well.I have narrow, flat feet. Size 10 worked well for me.My only complaint is that the tongue likes to slip to the side in ONE of the shoes when I slip them on. It didn't do that with my last pair and only does it with one shoe. Kind of annoying.

I bought one 3 years ago but in different color. Admittedly, they too were bigger then my true size. This time I needed different color but same model so I ordered smaller size.I was so bummed I had to return them because they were to large and they don’t have smaller size 😢

My shoe size is 10 1/2 when l ordered the shoes from you all l ordered half size bigger size 11 that way l knew l could use them. A little too big is ok. Well the new shoes size 11 too small. This shoe runs a size small 11 is 10 and so on. I know what size shoe l need.What l didn't know is this shoe runs a size small but no big deal.

I have the EXACT same shoe, but it's all black. I bought them locally. The size 14 is a little more roomy than I like but it's fine. THIS shoe, however, is much smaller and tighter. It feels like a 13. The leather is thinner and the cuts aren't near as precise as they should be and the insole is just a slab of memory foam, whereas the locally purchased shoe has a nice sole/midsole THEN it has a fancy insole with a little arch support and a padded heel.They literally look like Chinese fakes. That's how bad they are. I emailed Puma and got no response. Amazon just says send them back. They didn't even care that they were basically cheap copies. 🤷🏼‍♂️

Cool looking and comfortable shoe. I really wasn't expecting to be so happy when I saw them come in the mail but I certainly got what I payed for. Once I put them on I could run faster, longer, and jump higher. I challenged Usain Bolt to a race and I won! I won! Then I went back and beat all of those kids I lost races to in Kindergarten and watched them cry as full grown adult. I then proceeded to walk around town and all of the girls just had to stop and stare as I passed by, they just couldn't get enough of the sneaker. All in all, I would have to recommend these shoes to everyone I know, mostly because of the badass that they have turned me into.Results may vary.

We are now having to resort to buying shoes online for my son, since majority of our local stores do not carry shoes in his size.I am very pleased with the speedy 2 day shipping with Prime.My son said the shoes fit great! They are not too tight or big on the sides & feel comfortable! He doesn't feel like he has to ""break them in"" like his previous shoes.Upon inspection the shoes look durable & they may actually last until we have to buy his next pair.The other thing that caught my eye to purchase this particular shoe was the price! An AMAZING deal for the style, brand & size. My son has grown so quickly that we are buying new shoes every couple of months so this price was easy on the pocket book.

Arch support is decent but their a little snug on the toes. A tad bit on the noisy side. Clump a lot like boots sometimes. After wearing these shoes for some time I wouldn’t recommend them. These shoes are not very comfortable and are cheaply made. Maybe spend a little bit more to get a higher quality shoe.

This shoe is comfortable as a general workout shoe, or for occasional runs of a mile or two.  There are other shoes better-suited to frequent or long runs.  One intangible - they look good.

I have bought over 10 pairs of this exact style at different times and years. The first 6 pairs where exactly the same, after that I noticed a slight change  bit by bit, the change was taking place, quite small to notice at first, but the last I purchase was definitely drastic. The material feels like it was made with the least expensive rubber band available. I loved this shoes so much this was going to be my set for life, but now ""NO MORE"". Quite upsetting. The support is horrible, I wear them for 1 hour and my feet hurt for 24 hours after that, I rather walk bare feet. I wish I could get a refund but I guess is too late.

If you are looking for all black work shoes, look no further. Seriously comfortable soles and tough on outsides. The soles feel like small plush pillows in your shoes. The design looks nice, very clean cool look to them. Not made for running or athletic use because the outside material is pretty tough and doesn't have much flexibility to run or workout in them. If your feet run wide don't get them, pumas run narrow towards the toe. I also read people having issues with them running a half inch smaller which I agree they do but they didn't have a half inch size up option so just get your normal size, should be fine.
"

I personally hate how 99% of all running shoes look. I know appearance has nothing to do with function but could it really hurt for companies to come out with better looking shoes? These are one of the few running shoes that I actually like the way they look. I can wear them anywhere with anything and look good in them. Way to go Puma!Most importantly though these feel great. They fit like a glove on me (size 12) and are very light. I recently ran a 5K in these and my feet felt great. No signs of them wearing out and they seem very well built. Will look to Puma running shoes for my future purchases.
"
4628,"
I have been using this for a couple of months now and the shoes have gotten more comfortable over the period. They arrived a snug fit for my size even when I have been using a standard PUMA shoe size for years. However, as compared to earlier Puma shoes that I have these seem to be on lower side for performance and quality. The insole of the shoes has already worn out in my 2months of use for aerobic activities of about 3hours everyday. I would recommend buying a better brand if performance is the prime reason for buying these.

I have been buying 3 pairs per year for a few years now...these last ones feel like clown shoes!  I will not buy them again.  They now have some sort of thicker insert inside to make up for the changes they made to the shoe structure.  I feel clumsy and floppy every time I get up and start walking.I will now be faithfully buying a different brand.  I hate when a company cuts corners on one of their top products...WHY DO YOU THINK IT WAS RATED A TOP PRODUCT IN THE FIRST PLACE?!  IT WASN'T JUST BECAUSE THEY LOOK NICE.  IT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE MADE WELL...not any more.

Wore these off and on for 7 months.  There is something off on the construction of the heel.  Its as if I'm my heels are standing on golf balls.  It was annoying at first and eventually painful.

This is the 2nd pair of Puma running I have owned. I like the fit and the style. The shoe holds up to normal wear and tear and can be wiped clean to continue looking new. The shoe isn't really flexible to expand for a wider foot, so keep this in mind when choosing your shoe size. It does saying running shoe, but I dont use these shoes when jogging and prefer a lighter  shoe with more cushion in the heel. A great shoe for relaxed weekends.
"

Soo I bought these because they looked good and were a great price. I regret buying them. I am a heavier guy but trying to get my steps and walks in. OMFG!! The blisters that form EVERY time I go walking on the ball of my feet are massive and HURT. The memory foam soles were a great touch when I first put them on. I was super excited about having a memory foam sole. Theyre great for sedentary life but yes they do seem to fall apart. Ive had them for about 2 months and they look like they're 2 years old at this point. I have plenty of other awfulness about them but Ill skip all that just like you should skip this purchase and move on to a nice set of Nike's. These shoes are rubbish.

I had searched high and low for Puma sneakers for my husband, and he couldn't be more pleased with these!!  I've always known Puma to fit a bit narrower than your average tennis shoes, so keep that in mind if you are a first time buyer of Pumas.  My husband has more narrow feet for a guy, so these shoes really do fit like they were made for him.  He has worn them regularly...nearly daily since April, and they have held up wonderfully!!  That is after hiking SEVERAL miles in them in all conditions too!  Great support for the arch and cushy overall on the soles!
"
4643,"
As with all shoes, they were tight to begin with. After giving time to wear in they have performed well. The one thing I have noticed is they run a little large. I wear a size 12 but probably could wear these in size 11.5. I wear these as my daily shoes and have normal cotton socks, but when I have worn them for workouts with thinner socks they are big. It is a little annoying but nothing major. Since these are my daily sneakers it is not something I worry about. If I used them for workouts regularly then I would go for a smaller size.
"
4644,"
Good Value but would recommend ordering 1 size larger than normal as they run small
"

Size is perfect. Very comfortable and I love the memory foam like design of the inside of the shoe. I originally bought them only for the gym, but because they look so nice, I've ended up wearing them as a casual sneaker for the weekends. I might even get an extra pair.

Now I know why they sell the shoe in both medium and wide, in all sizes, as these run narrow.  I should have ordered a wide which likely would have fit like a medium.  Length wise they fit perfect.  Hoping they stretch a little as the box got thrown out, so no returning them for a wide.  Arch support is on the low side, but acceptable.  Otherwise, great shoes that are solidly constructed.

I LOVE Puma's and my boyfriend who has been joining me in a lot of my workouts was in need of a new shoe so I got these as a gift and now he LOVES them. We go for 3-4 mile walks daily, some jogging, lots of fitness classes such as circuits/boot camps with lots of cardio and jumping and these provide perfect amount of arch support. He was also cursed with totally flat feet and these help with that as well.
"
4659,"
Was on the fence between classifying as ""somewhat small"" or ""fit as expected.""  Why? Well, they are somewhat narrow, but in my experience most Puma running shoes are a bit narrower than other brands.  So if you are not familiar with the Puma fit, it may feel tight to you.  But if you are a Puma regular, it ""fits as expected.""  A little too shiny out of the box for my usual taste, but that goes away with wear. I bought these because so many other running shoes have mesh or fabric down towards the soles which just get soaked through walking on wet pavement which make my socks wet quickly. Not a problem here!
"

Good school at a descent price. Was a little narrow but it will stretch
"

It’s really hard to find a good shoe without goofy designs and colors anymore. I just want to gray shoe and no neon colors. Finally found that with this pair of Pumas. They fit great and are very light weight. They are gray so they should hide the dirt and look new for a good amount of time. I just need to make sure I put my old she’s on when I decide to mow the lawn or do some painting around the house. However, if I do forget to change them I’ll know right where I can go to get another pair!

Was exactly what I ordered but after 2 months already falling apart.
"

This is my third pair of this exact shoe - loved the first two pairs. This latest pair is different though. The shoe tongue is too short on this pair and after wearing them for an hour or so the tongue slides down and becomes very uncomfortable, necessitating me to completely undo the laces enough to pull up the tongue and try to tie it tight enough to help - can't be stopped though. Very obnoxious.  Why they would change this from the previous cuts is odd.
"
4664,"
Great walking shoes if you have flat feet. Excellent arch support, seems to make me roll off the practically non existent ball of my foot. The foam setting around the heel can wear out quickly but they generally hold up well. This is my third pair, I'll be sad when they stop making them.
"

Pretty decent sneaker. I am a carpenter and I wanted some beat around shoes for working when I'm on the roof installing.g metal sheeting.  Don't want to work in my J's so I bought these and I was pleasantly  surprised by how comfortable they are.

4666,"
This is my 2nd pair. First know they run small, I take a size 9 but with these I have to take an 11. I wore my first pair down, wearing it every day for like 4 months. That pair still looks good but at bottom of heal I can see significant wear but no holes, again I was wearing everyday.I wear these to work and no one notices I am not wearing shoes. Nice style.

I have the black/silver  and the white/red pair. I have MS with pins and needles (numbness) in my feet 24/7 and I can wear them all day without a problem.They fit well and they’re comfortable to wear. They also look great! Good Job Puma!!
"

I still like narrow toed sneakers, I think they look better on my foot, but they're so hard to find these days.  With the Tarzons I have the narrower toe than most sneakers and they are indeed comfortable and stylish enough to wear to casual events.  I like them so much that I own four pairs now in various colors.  The only downside, more of an observation than complaint, is the tongue shifts to the side at times, no lace loop to keep it in place.  Other than that, it is a wonderful shoe!
"
4669,"
I just got these and I really like them a lot.  They fit as expected and look smart!  I've been wearing them around the house and they feel good.  I still need to work them (i.e. walking/biking, etc.), but my initial impression is positive.  For years I've worn Asics, but I wanted a change.  I tried Nike and was horribly disappointed.  I know, I l know...they all make a zillion styes and there is probably some in each brand range that I would like.  That said, I wanted to try a new style and brand.  So far, I'm pleased with my choice.

Was a little tight around the toe area, but the sneaker has now relaxed and is comfortable to wear. It did not take long to break in. Has a memory foam insole, which makes it very comfortable. Time will tell if the sneaker integrity holds up, but the sneaker appears to be well made. I rate this product 4 out of 5 stars, due to the break in period. Other than that, I really like these sneakers.

The shoe helps you have cushion and contour as you stay active. From heel to toe  the ground impact on the muscles and bones of the foot is reduced. Providing proper support and light weight.

Got these for weight and plyometric workouts.  Very good for squats, leg press, etc.  these are categorized as running shoes.  I would not use these for running; too tight and heavy for my preference. However I do like them for gym workouts.  These are stiffer than my running shoes.  When doing box jumps - they feel heavy and does not flex.  These are narrow and therefore provide good stability for squat - leg press type of exercises.

I'd bought the teen size of these same shoes for my son and when I saw how cool they looked and how they oddly seemed to resist immediate destruction at the hands of an abusive 6th grader I had to get a pair.

Love this shoe.  I wear a 10 wide, I bought the 10.5 .... it’s perfect!  For a guy dealing with plantar fasciitis for a few decades, this shoe can be worn without orthotics, as the heel when  seated in the trainer, is so secure.  There is fine support from toe to heel.  I have already purchased a second pair.  I am fast becoming a Puma fan.  They have done for me, what other big brands could not.  Bravo!
"
4694,"
I bought these because I liked the style.  And that's the last nice thing I can say.  These are hands down the most uncomfortable shoe I can remember wearing.  They are as flat a pine board with an insole that feels just like the sponge I have on the kitchen sink.  If I had to do a bit of shopping for an hour or so, I could manage in these shoes without dying.  Walk a couple miles for pleasure?  No.  Work one eight hour shift on my feet?  Not without a week vacation and two foot transplants afterwards.  Anything more than idling in a chair reading a book while wearing these shoes is an act of contempt for one's own feet.  I have about ten hours in these torture devices and then I gave up, my knees and back couldn't take it.  If you have flat feet, was a grunt in the Army, or just hate your feet in general, good luck to you sir.

Pumas are always gonna run slim. If you have a wide foot Puma like a few other brands should be avoided.  For me I’m normal width but I knew these were only for style in the gym for weights and elliptical.  Since they are all leather, you need to break them in.  Think about a cockpit!  You will sit in there, be snug but still able to move a little.  That’s what these are. But overall it’s been a few months and they work well for me.

This is our third pair as my son's feet grow. We found them first at a local store then ordered the others on-line over time. He wears them all-season everywhere. They have held up even in the winter snow, ice and slush on his commute to, and at, school in Eastern Europe. We just hope they keep making this style for a long time to come.

This is my 3rd pair of these same shoes over the last few years and for whatever reason these are not working as well as the last 2.  The tongue on the left shoe will not stay in place, after about 100 steps its all the way down on the side of my foot.  I'm actually wondering if there is a defect in the stitching or something. This pair also feels very slippery on wet surfaces where I never noticed that before.  Manufacturing changes?  Knockoffs?  I don't know, but i wont be buying them again.

I like Puma shoes.  I have a narrow flat foot, but these shoes still fit me good.  They are a very good value and are not made in China!  They are made in Vietnam.  Not a great fan of Vietnam, but better than China.  They are made well and look very nice.

These Puma sneakers are amazing from the second I put them on. The soft foam optimal insole is soooooo comfortable. They are stylish without being over the top.

This is a good shoe for wearing around the house, but I can't wear them if I am wearing athletic socks.  They are too tight in the toe box and pretty snug everywhere else.  I never had a problem with this with Brooks, Adidas, or New Balance athletic shoes.  So with that said, I wear them as house shoes, and they're very comfortable.  But if I want to wear socks, I'd have to order one size bigger I think.

This shoe is really nice and sleek-looking, but the toe box seems narrow.  Also, there's no ventilation. As for comfort, there's very little cushioning in the sole. After wearing them for about 3 hours, I had to take them off because the balls of my feet were so sore. It's a cute shoe, but not the most comfortable.

These shoes are a tight fit, but not too small so it ended up working well for me.  The sole is well padded comfortable, my feet are never sore from walking or running.  I personally find them stylish with the way the logos and highlights are designed.  Just remember they do run a bit tight so keep that in mind if you have very wide feet.Saw some reviews about how these shoes get dirty.  Are you serious?  These are running shoes, of course they'll get dirty.

I bought 3 pairs of this red white and black model Pumas that lasted 5 years so I know a little bit about them. I also have a gray and white pair that are nice too. They used to be a great shoe. That's why I bought 4 pairs in the last 6 years. I still use 2 of the pairs. When I put on my old pair bought years ago they are way better than my newest pair. They changed the look a little bit too on the new red and whites but that's actually OK, I like it. I'm not happy with the changes they made to the comfort and feel of the shoe. This latest pair is poorly made and uncomfortable. It feels like a cheap pair of sneakers now. They are clunky and awkward and the sole feels flat so I wont be buying and Pumas again. I'll go back o Nikes or Reeboks.

Great shoe at a great price, slightly snug feel, but not truly size altering. I may have gone for a half size larger than I did, but overall very satisfied.

Overall, I like this shoe. Initially, it was very snug (which I attributed to my size: 6'4"" 255 lbs). After about 10 minutes of wear, it loosened up nicely. The insole is very comfortable. I don't like the  shiny heel wrap, and had I noticed it before purchase, I might have chosen something else. I'mglad I didn't, though. I like this shoe and, depending on how it wears, I would buy it again.

I bought this pair of Pumas for my dad and he loves them. The fit is perfect, however I ordered one size up for more room in the toe box. The running shoe has a round toe design and my dad prefers a roomy fit.  Otherwise, the design is sporty, the fit is comfortable for running or walking, and the color white is brilliant; older gents love white athletic sneakers lol.  The package arrived earlier than expected. Thank you Amazon and Puma my dad appreciates your good products and services.

The most comfortable shoe I've owned in a long time. Excellent fit, perhaps a little snug. Normally my feet will get a little tired with most shoes after a long day on my feet but not once have my feet hurt with these shoes. Good grip on the sole. Very good foot and ankle support. Very reasonably priced overall and a lot of color variations. Very clean classy look. Would definitely recommend to anyone!

I bought these sneakers in july of this year (2021). I have worn these just to walk around not to do any exercise or anything like that. And yet today I looked down and see that the leather/pleather has split over my right pinky toe. You can clearly see a hole in the shoe on the picture I am not happy at all and would love a refund. UPDATE--10/19/2021 I was told by AMAZON staff that because the return date  was well past the 30 days. They would not refund my hard earned money and that I was told to COMPLAIN TO THE MANUFACTURER. So I did that and sent a kindly worded email explaining my situation to puma. I have gone 3 business days without a single response.  I was a loyal fan of puma sneakers for 7 plus years  but after the blatant disregard and lack of recognition from them I WILL NOT BUY A SINGLE THING FROM PUMA EVER AGAIN and I urge you to stay far away from this particular type of sneaker and from PUMA in general.

They look great, and are very comfortable. They also fit as expected. The thing is, there is practically 0 ventilation with these shoes.

These are one of the best shoes I have ever owned. I bought these shoes for walking and its comfortable so I ended up using in my world travel. These shoes are not meant for hiking but I used them (they do not perform well as hiking shoes). My point is I have used them in all sorts of environments and they have lasted me a over a year. I have use these shoes in Glaciers in Norway to mountains in Argentina to daily use at home. I love them!

This is a great looking running shoe, if you happen to like the lighter shoe colors, as I do. Support is good, although the shoes do keep my feet a little warmer than I would like. This pair of shoes served as a replacement for my worn 10 year old Nike Air Max. Let's see how it performs...

The reason behind the 3 out of 5 is because the foam inserts wasn’t glued down and slip out every time I remove my feet from the shoes.Also had random stitching that I had to cut in the toe area to slip my feet into the shoes.I also noticed the stitching going around the left shoe is loose so we will see how long the shoes last.The hassle of returning and getting another pair is the only reason I’ve kept them. Wanted to order another pair if this pair fit right but I’ll probably looked elsewhere.

This is my first pair of Puma's ever and like most, I've been wearing Nikes for decades. These are nice looking shoes but they are a little narrow and require a little breaking in, especially the left foot which the shoe was rubbing my ankle. I would give 4.5 due to having to break them in.

The price was right so I overlooked some of the comments. I have only worn them a few times and so far the fit is perfect, the looks great and I almost bounce in my walk.

I had just bought Filas for a higher price and far less quality. wish I had returned them!

I weigh 300lbs so I go through shoes about every 3 months or so.  I bought these about 3 months ago and they still feel and look like brand new!  I am very impressed with them.  I have high arches which are supported just enough.  I will say they probably wouldn't be great for running, but I wear them as a daily shoe at work and in the evenings and they are great for that purpose.  I like them so much that I just bought a 2nd pair to have on hand when this pair gets worn out.

I purchased these a half size larger due to everyone's reviews stating they fit a little small.  I normally wear a 10.5 and got these in 11 and they're actually about a half size to big for me.  This is my first pair of Puma's and so far i'm pretty happy with them as my work now allows these types of athletic shoes with our business casual attire.  Shoe's have a nice comfortable fit, look great and were just what I was wanting being all black.  I can deal with the half size to big, I just tie them a little tighter.

For the price, they're solid shoes for someone with flat feet. The break-in time is roughly a week, or 25 miles worth of walking. I'd recommend bringing a second pair of shoes with you so that whenever the Pumas begin to hurt your feet you can switch, to give your feet a break until you break them in.They aren't the most comfortable, as the ""Soft foam comfort insert"" isn't all that comfortable; another gel insert would help. But once you've broken them in, they offer solid support; I've noticed that my knee and lower-back pain has diminished, which is always a plus!All in all, I'd give the shoes a 3.5 out of 5; good shoes to beat around in for work if you know you're gonna mess them up.

My ordinary shoe size he is nine and a half to 10. This shoe is extremely tight and narrow. It is definitely not true to size. I would have like to have exchanged the shoe for a full size larger to an 11. However, there would be a price increase involved up from $35 to $59.94. I tried to take care of this through ""chat,"" but was not successful in reaching a satisfactory conclusion. Somehow or another I got bounced off of the proper website to continue.

They seem to size smaller than normal My shoe size is a Mens 10 1/2 (US) and when I bought another pair of Pumas 4 years ago they were really tight when I bought them in my size. With these Tazon 6's I bought them a size larger than I needed (Mens 11 1/2 US) and they fit me perfectly.

Excellent shoes, I love this model and have bought  it many times, good quality. The reason I said I have bought it many times it’s because I have a discrepancy between my two legs so my shoes get worn off unevenly so I usually use a pair of shoes not longer than three months, however this model and brand are very very well made and it last me almost 6 months, for those who need a nice looking shoe, comfortable, and need a strong support to not tweak your ankle, great option!

Gave this product 3 stars based on looks alone.  I ordered my normal size but these sneakers are just plain uncomfortable.  I’ve try putting shoe trees in them to try and stretch them but so far they are just not comfortable to wear for any period of time. Problem is not in the length, it is more in the lack of comfort with the insole and across the arch.  Maybe it will get better with time,  but for now, they are certainly not my go to sneaker for comfort.

In the first pair that I bought, I noticed the tongue of the shoe would slip drastically off to the side regardless of how many times I straightened it or tightened or loosened the strings. I thought I just got a bad pair so I sent them back and requested a replacement. The replacement shoe’s tongue still slips in the new pair. I have never had a pair of shoes do this. Such an incredibly lazy design. These shoes would have been worthy of 5 stars if someone had fixed this.

I wore these shoes twice so far since I've had them and they're just a little bit too snug there narrow wasn't expecting them to be this snug hopefully after a few more times of wearing them I can stretch them out a little other than that nice looking pair of shoes. I've bought Pumas before and actually forgot that they do fit somewhat small about half size smaller than a normal shoes that I wear. So basically my fault for not rememberin.

I got the 1st pair of shoe in 2011 and it went around with me till 2015, then in between I used many shoes which didnt last much and then I went back to this shoe and glad I did it.As expected a great pair for Gym and stylish in going around. In Office I got lot of compliment for the shoe and everyone was asking where I got this.

This is my 2nd purchase of the same shoe. I work out quite often and play basketball frequently. These shoes were durable and allowed me to make quick turns on the court without any visible give or damage to the shoes. The only reason why I am buying a 2nd pair because my shoe was subject to my little niece putting a knife through my first pair (don't ask). Otherwise the shoes have lasted roughly two months and were a great purchase.

Very comfortable and look as well as fit as expected overall

The toe portion is really wide and loose. Even someone with wide feet will complain. The heel is lower than the toe so it feels like you're always walking uphill. No arch support. The look is a reminder of Nike Shox, but no where near the quality. The rubber in the toe was wrinkling after 3 hours of wear. Sent both pairs back immediately. Got a white and black pair. Neither of them fit like regular shoes. Didn't realize Puma was such a low quality brand.
"
4855,"
So I tend to rebuy this style of puma because I love how they fit and feel in my foot. They also last quite a while as I use them daily for work (medical field). My only surprise was that I thought I was buying a black pair, and they were act it actually dark grey. They are very nice, just not what I thought what I was originally ordering. Won't return them though because again, they are some good looking shoes.

My 10yo son wore these for only two months. While cleaning them, I discovered BOTH soles were completely worn through! Obviously they did not go back on his feet after this discovery. I have never seen this in ANY of his shoes - this must be either defect or very sub-par quality. Recently bought Pumas for myself and I hope this will not be the fate of those as well. Will not be buying Pumas again after this.

When I first put these shoes on I thought they were uncomfortable and tight.  After walking in them for about a week I can say they are very comfortable with great cushion.  I don't run a lot but I walk many miles a day and these shoes feel like much more expensive running shoes.  I wear shoes out quickly.  Only time will tell how they'll wear and I'll update my review.

Returned because they were too small (12"") and I needed 12.5"" which wasn't available at the time of my order. Very good looking pair of shoes. The only concern about the shoes is that the insoles were not removable; which would be fine except that I wear orthotics in my shoes and I've found in the past that my orthotics work better under the insoles.

I am a 13 slim yet these Puma's fit snug on my feet and feel like they are part of my body. They look sharp and feel great to walk in on my treadmill. I do not use these outside as they are specifically for walking 3-6 miles per day on my treadmill. I definitely enjoy these and given my foot is narrow, I would caution buyers with thicker feet to be careful. These were perfect for me however!

It’s the first time he’s come home from work in three years and his feet haven’t been in pain.

I like Pumas because they are made for narrower runner type feet. These are sharp looking shoes. One thing I did knock a star for, why I returned them- there is some puckering when you take a step on the inside of the arch- I was concerned these could get worse over time and really I was buying these for the look. I had another 2 pairs of Pumas over time and loved them, these seem a 1/4 size too big in comparison to those though.
"
4885,"
I have been buying these exact shoes for almost 5 years and my most recent pair will be my last Puma product. If you notice all the positive reviews are old if you asked me 2 years ago if I would recommend these I would yell yes. But they recently changed the materials and manufacturing process they use to make the shoes and quality has tanked. My pair before my most recent I noticed the drop in quality but it wasn't enough to completely sway me, but my most recent pair has been a nightmare. My last pair lasted about a year but did show signs of wear before that, but the pair I just bought didn't even last a month before falling apart and I can feel how much cheaper they are made now. If you value your money stay away from these. I used to be extremely loyal to the puma brand but clearly, they don't care anymore so neither do I. What a disgrace to the company.
"
4886,"
Decent shoes.  Not surprised of my dislike for them, knowing the price.  Fit well and decently comfortable.  Profile is too low.  Wont buy again but I'll rock' em til they fall apart..which would most likely be within a few months.  Good for restaurant workers n such jobs alike. Not good for the rugged and wild.

Fit size is bit larger than nike,  really like the outside of the shoe,  very well constructed and nothing plastic.  The in-sole is not that great.  Not much cushion and is already starting to come out when taking off the shoe.
"

I only wore these to work for a desk job and the glued on soles of both shoes is coming apart after a month of very light use.  This is annoying because when you drive you can feel the heel part of the shoe separated and on the front part of you walk thru grass it gets caught in the front part of the sole that's separated.Would not again. I've had Nike, Adidas and new balance shoes last much longer and still held together.

I’ve worn pumas for about 3 years now and loved them. I walk about 10-15 miles a day and go through shoes quickly. When I used pumas the first time I thought it wouldn’t last, but it did. Outlasted the adidas, Nike’s, saucony, and new balance that I had tried.

Son tenis muy lindas, me agradaron bastante. Las pedí un poco grandes (media talla más) y digamos que queda un dedo de espacio (por lo que no queda muy grande y ni pequeñas). Puede que sea falta de costumbre pero se sienten con mucha suela suave que al rato no es tan confortable como para andar caminando mucho (pero son las primeras impresiones). Excelente producto y compra.

I bought these for my man. He has wide feet and I know these shoes are narrow, so I bought a size larger. He has issues wearing shoes due nerve damage from a bad back surgery. Unfortunately he feels the pain in his foot and toes. He has tried several pairs of shoes and can only wear them for very short periods of time because they aggravate his foot. These can tolerate wearing for a longer period of time. I just recently ordered him his second pair.

I order Puma Men's Tazon shoes every winter for my hubby as a gift. He loves these shoes! We always order the Tazon line (different colors and styles of Tazon). After months of searching and trying over 25+ pairs of shoes, he finally found a style that works. We've been buying the Tazon line for 3 years now!The quality of this line is great. He wears them almost daily and they hold up well. The last pair after 9 months of wearing them (daily) the only wear we saw was inside the shoe where the back of his ankle hits. The support of the shoe after about a year of wearing them almost daily obviously isn't as good as before, but he always says they're still comfortable. Shoes for him are hard to find since most are uncomfortable for his feet and don't fit correctly. At one point a few years ago we'd tried over 25+ pairs of sneakers (various stores, brands, styles in the same brands, etc) and he couldn't wear any of them! We'd even tried other Pumas with no luck.It was so frustrating and extremely frustrating for him. You see, we'd been through this with dressier shoes as well, tried on a lot. He wanted to give up. Well I'd seen an add for the Puma Tazons and after about an hour of convincing him I got him to try them on. Typically he can tell if a shoe won't work for him the moment he tries them on or walks in them for less than ten seconds. I'd ordered his size and also half a size up. He put them on, walked around and from the look on his face I could tell they worked for him. I will say that he is always a 9, but for this shoe the 9 1/2 fit better for him, so you might want to try the half size up if your regular size doesn't feel right when you try them on. I love how the Tazon line has a bunch of styles and colors too! I've recommended this shoe to a lot of people and will continue to do.If I had my way I'd order a vast amount of colors and styles, but he isn't someone who likes to wear a bunch of different shoes. I did get two pairs this holiday season and told him he's going to alternate to change it up.Thank you Puma for making a good quality shoe that works well for my hubby.

I was looking for something comfortable for my son and I to do our daily walks in for Pokemon Go.  They were on sale for 29.99 and I figured why not.  The memory foam mentioned in the product description is way under rated.  It really wonderful and absorbs so much impact compared to my last pair which were thick soled New Balance.  I'm in the high 200s, so that's significant when talked about cushioning the bottom of the foot.  Saw a few people talked about tight in the toe.  If you just slip them on and lace them up that will definitely be a thing.  I relaced them a bit more to my comfort level and they're just fine.  I think the pre-lacing on these is for the maximum snug fit.  All in all, super impressed with these and thinking of buying another pair or 2 for backup while they're cheap.
"

I liked this shoe a lot and the price was right. These shoes were a half size too large for me. I need a snug fitting shoe. They felt great and premium to the touch. The color was very nice. The footbed was comfortable enough to wear all day. There was plenty of traction and grip. I did return these and would have gladly exchanged for a half size smaller but at the time they did not have the size I needed. I will probably give these shoes another whirl next time if the babe my size.

I walk 40 minutes every morning on a combination of sidewalks and well-maintained dirt trails.  I've had these shoes for a week, and had I not put 30+ miles on them, I'd send them back.  The insole is supposed to be ""soft foam for ultimate comfort.,"" and to the touch it is.  However, it compresses to virtually nothing.  With each step I can feel the tread design on the sole, and if I step on a a rock, I can feel it as well.  Needless to say, they make my feet ache.  Not only that, for some curious reason my calves also ache after walking in them. I don't know if its the way they are designed or the way I tend to walk.  Regardless, my feet kick and scream in rebellion when I put them on!That's the negative side.  On the plus side, they fit as expected.  They are definitely light and don't have clunky soles, so they are easy to walk in.  And, I like the graphics!For me, they aren't the best shoe.  If you buy them, I'd suggest you try them out on the type surface you're going to be walking/running on.  I didn't.  I tried them on a carpet in my house and they seemed fine.  Good luck.

I had 2 other pair of puma that were twice as expensive. They fit better and have way better build quality and support. I just assumed these would be the same but honestly they feel like you're wearing fake shoes. There's no structure to them and when you walk they feel like they're just kind of end-pieces around your feet, but definitely not any kind of shoe designed for actual athletic support in any way. The color is uniform and black which is fine, but honestly I regret buying these

"

As other reviewers have stated, these shoes run 1/2 size small.  The toe box is narrow, and the length is shorter than Nike athletic shoes.  Order 1/2 size larger than your regular street shoe size, and you should be fine.  The materials feel a bit cheap, compared to higher end athletic shoes (I.e. synthetic materials and very poor orthotic support).  I would not run in these, or use them for weight training due to stability issues.  I wear these shoes with jeans, for casual events that require limited walking.  The insoles are padded with foam inserts, but they are far less comfortable than most running shoes.  I’m not expecting these shoes to hold up under extreme training conditions, so I will use them for running errands, social gatherings, etc.  Worth the reasonable price for the style/look, but not the most robust athletic shoe for serious workouts.

This was going to get a 1 star when I first got these but I decided to wait a little longer to write the review.

I wasn't expecting the time it took to break them in to be so long but now I enjoy wearing them because I am on my feet all day and I desperately need some comfortable shoes. The price wasn't terrible when I was looking for a new pair and I have had people recommend this brand. Probably won't buy them again when they wear out but I'm glad I didn't spend a lot for them.

I ordered these mostly because I thought they looked cool. Didn’t read any reviews and honestly, my previous experience with Puma goes back to the 1980s.I ordered a 9 1/2 because that is my normal size. 43 in European sizes. The Euro size on the box is a 42 1/2. Looks like I’ll have to send these back and exchange them for a pair of 10s.Other than how tight the toe box is on my big toe, these shoes seem quite well put together and the insole is super soft & comfy. Still really like how they look too. Will update later if I’m able to exchange them for the bigger size.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE!!! I'm a mail carrier and these are the most comfortable sneakers I've had in a while. I usually have to replace the inserts but w/these I feel like I'm walking on air. Before I bought these I read the reviews where they've fallen apart or the tongue separated from the sneaker. I bought them on May 21st & check them everyday, and I don't see anything yet. I ordered another pair that's being delivered tomorrow so that I have another pair waiting in the wings. GO PUMA!!!!10/23/22-SOOOO I found a flaw in both pairs. They tore at the same spot on the right foot. I was wearing them both 5-6 days a week, 8-10 hours/day, for almost 6 months. But guess what? My new pair came yesterday😁. This might be my last pair for work. I already see a women's pair that I'm definitely getting.

BLUF: The soft, comfortable insides of Pumas are the main reason for my switch and stick with Pumas.I remember when I was younger and much poorer than I am now, every once in a while my dad would take me to go get some fresh pair of Jordans because those were his favorites (If nothing else, he made sure we at least had good fit shoes). Growing fast and having big feet, I would always need new shoes. So I would go with it until, one time, we couldn't find a fit for me. That's when accidentally came across the superfine pair of Pumas, the most comfortable pair of shoes I had ever decided to put my feet into. Needless to say, since then Pumas became my shoe-of-choice ever since then. Even now that I make my own paycheck, I still have trouble getting shoes because I have pretty wide feet. I've bout other shoes and other brands, but they don't always have a Wide Sized pair of 14s you know? (I get tired of going in-store and them not having my size or even buying shoes online just for them not to be wide enough for my feet). So, yes. Both I and my feet have been happy, despite my dad's disappointment.

I received these bad boys on Saturday. I bought these bad boys strictly for training at the gym. I just finish hitting the weights while wearing these awesome shoes. I highly recommend for leg days. My reason for recommending, is because of the low heel at the back of the shoe. It gives support and comfort while training legs.I highly recommend this brand for overall comfort and a stunning looking style. Black is my favorite color for this shoe.

The toe box is very tight. I have a broad ball of the foot and run to a wide fit with a narrow heel. So, fit for me is difficult. The material is very sturdy and doesn't lend itself to stretch. Other Puma footwear has accommodated this. Good for a workout, but I can't imagine a full day of wear. I would need a wider toe or maybe go up a size. Like the shoe, but be cautious on the sizing. Not sized for American men.

These shoes are very nice for the price. They are comfortable and supportive, and at first look great too.

I love the sleek look and feel of these sneakers. They have good support and tighten up to fit narrow feet. The dull black pleather on the top is great for resisting dirt and smudges. This is my second pair; will keep buying.
"
5236,"
For the price, they are a great looking, great fitting pair of shoes.  Comfortable, just the right amount of snug, and the weight feels good.  Hard to beat the value for the price, and the looks are second to none IMO.The reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is that I bought them to use a a cross trainer.  The soft sole (very similar to memory foam) is quite comfortable for daily wear, but it is not a great option for an actual trainer.  Too much give leads to variable performance during running and training, especially resistance training or crossfit style training where a sturdy base is imperative.  Also, the outer material that offers outstanding appearance is not breathable compared to alternatives.Ultimately, it is a great looking and comfortable daily wear sneaker, with a neutral color that wears well with most anything.  I just do not use it for any planned exercise activity.
"
5237,"
They fit as expected. Really comfortable, light. I'm using these to go out to the store, go for leisure walks. I'm not sure how they will handle running or any other sports. This is my 3rd pair of pumas and I am actually loving them. They are affordable compared to other brands!
"

Summary: This is an adequate casual sneaker that fits well. However, this shoe didn't hold up under prolonged activity nor did it hold up after changing the insoles.One day, I took my lunchtime three mile walk in these shoes. The ball of my right foot started feeling friction burn about two miles in, so I curled my toes in to compensate for the final mile. That caused heel pain that is ongoing a month later despite rest and change in footwear. I'll concede this was self-inflicted for improperly compensating.Then, I changed out the insoles hoping for more comfort and support, but it feels like walking directly on concrete despite the pair of insoles I used. That said, the memory foam insoles that come with these shoes do suffice (minus the friction burn I'd get). I've taken my lunchtime walk while wearing Sketchers Outdoor memory foam shoes many times and never had this issue.This has been an extremely frustrating experience, but these shoes had sufficed under everyday, low-activity situations.
"
5239,"
These are great shoes, and very comfortable, but, as a normal size 9.5 on a regular, these were very tight. I had to exchange for a 10W to have a better fit. The shoe size runs small, so add a .5 or full size, and wider if applicable...
"
5240,"
These shoes are soo comfortable. They literally on great, even better was the price.
"
5241,"
I am not a runner, but I tend to find 'running' shoes to be the most comfortable type for everyday wear. I went with this shoe for both the price, and the classic look.It is borderline between being true to fit and running small. I wear anywhere from a normal width 11.5 to a 12 wide depending on the brand. Ordered the 12 here. it fits very snug, but not cramped. I went for a short jog in them and there was no pain or otherwise discomfort from the fit. In a perfect world, the toe box would be a quarter inch wider for me.Unlike most of today's running shoes, this has a harder rubber sole instead of the very soft, pliable rubber. over the long haul, I would suspect that long distance running would wind up being less comfortable. For me this is a walking around shoe though, so that won't be a problem. The inside padding is different from what I have seen in other brands, kind of a very firm memory foam rather than a gel liner. Feels comfortable enough so far.All in all, pretty happy with the purchase and will be keeping them.

so i bought these thinking they look cool, i want to transition to a new brand and this was my new go to for shoes, shirts, and so on. well one year later they are tearing.....never ran in them, hardly walked in them, and never used for work. I guess on the left side i also developed a hole....i cant blame the shoes on that one, but i can say they are thin. the sole is tearing from the toe box and idk why. if you buy, just be cautious.

I was a bit skeptical about purchasing shoes online, but I was certain of my foot size, so I decided to go for it anyway. I’ve never been to a store that sells quality shoes, so purchasing them online seemed convenient. I’m sure glad I bought them.Before these, I was wearing another rather expensive pair of shoes (probably overpriced) that I bought at a mall. They were $70—the most I’ve spent on a pair of shoes. I liked them, but they provide zero traction and zero support. Basically, they’re good for showing off, even though they’re not flashy in the least bit. I walk a lot, so I need shoes that are comfortable to wear, and in these harsh Minnesota winters they need traction as well.I searched for shoes on Amazon and these Puma shoes came up. They look nice, feature my favorite color scheme (black, white, and red), and they’re actual tennis shoes. You know, the shoes that are supposed to be comfortable. Well, these shoes are comfortable. I don’t even think I’ll need to swap the insoles (I tried removing them, but they didn’t seem to budge. Maybe I need more force) because the ones they ship with are comfortable enough. Standing on my feet for six hours, I can say I noticed a significant reduction in sore footedness, if that’s a word.I plan to make these my daily drivers, and I imagine they’ll hold up for at least a few years. I’ll just need to be sure to clean them every once in a while, so they maintain their whiteness.

All I know is that this shoe fits my feet perfectly. Don't ask me about sizes or whatever. Numbers never mean anything to me, because from one brand to another, or one style to another, etc etc everything is different. I really don't appreciate it either.This shoe looks like it'd hurt your feet due to the thin sole and not much support, at least I think. That's pretty wrong though. I've worn these all day, even sweating all day. I've never had any pain at all. No fatigue, nothing. I've walked in water and rain and hours with soaked feet. Been out on blacked pavement in the worst heat for hours. Walked and ran over about every kind of terrain, hey comfortable shoes are hard to find. Very hard to find. I'll wear them no matter what. I even wore them when I spent a week in the woods building training shelters for missionaries. I'm not saying they came back looking new, but they didn't have any wear and my feets were nice and comfy. That's why I got 3 of them.

I returned these huge-ass 9.5 Puma shoes and get size 9. Now my feet fits. So a recommendation for you - get a half-a-size smaller shoes cause Puma doesn't know foot sizes. Otherwise good shoes. Looks cool and feels good. (Also, don't put you pee-pee in the shoe.)

Based on a lot of the reviews as well as Puma's typically running narrower, I ordered a 12 instead of my usually 11.5.  The width was good, but the 12 was definitely too long.  They seem like a decent, casual shoe, but probably won't hold up for lots of walking/moving around.  I may get an 11.5 just to have as an extra pair to wear with khakis to work.

I bought this shoe August 10, 2020 for my son (20) who goes out of the house 2 times a week.  Where he walks out of the house to sits in a car and walks into a building then sits for 3 hours to turn around and come home. So their maybe on his feet 7 hours a week.  About 2 1/2 months after purchase he went to put them on and the tongue came out of one shoe.  I contacted Amazon and because it was past the 30 day return window they gave me Puma's email address to deal with them directly.  After 5 days, 6 emails and 2 phone calls it has come to a full circle where they are not responsible either. By the way contacting them gives you another BS run around.  With the first two back and fourth emails I sent them the amazon receipt with pictures of the shoe and a detailed description of what was needed.  They emailed me not once but, twice saying they weren't responsible for lost or damaged products coming from a different retailer. (I take ""damage"" meaning in the mail ect. Not manufacturing related where the tongue wasn't sewed in right).  Being I didn't purchase them directly from Puma.com.  So with that said I am now out $54.99 and have a brand new pair of shoes with no warranty on the quality make of these shoes.  Sadly when I bought these I still believed PUMA was a well made higher quality shoe.  So BUYERS BEWARE they look nice, wear nice until they don't.  Then no one is responsible for the manufactures error of quality control.  I am still shocked that AMAZON WON'T HELP EITHER.  STARTING TO WONDER IF THEY ARE GETTING TO BIG FOR THEIR OWN BRITCHES.

This shoe was kind of a let down after wearing my Nike Winflo 5’s almost every day. I bought these for a decent shoe to wear around the warehouse that I wouldn’t worry about beating up on. They do meet that description, but they definitely don’t have the bounce or support of my old nikes. I’ve actually switched back to my tattered nikes because I had started having some pains after wearing the pumas. (I probably walk about 8mi per day at work). I use them now as just some basic kick around shoes for when it’s raining and I need something I don’t care about getting dirty. Hoping that they just last longer than some Walmart shoes.

This is a 6-month review:I purchased these for a couple of different cross-training programs. One focused on weight training, while the other involved a lot of speed, agility, and sweat! After about 4-6 months, the outside is still very much intact: The sole is still tight to the outsole, there is no wear & tear on the upper, and the fit is still just right (no real stretching). The padding in the heel has worn away significantly on both shoes. This is nothing an extra pair of socks can't handle, but this is...well, I guess you could call it this shoe's Achilles heel, both literally and figuratively.

Like the shoes. They look good when you get them. I like how they have the outside sole built into shoe design, so the bottom looks slimmer and sleeker profile. Fit as expected. What I found I like less is that they come across as a bit bulky. Inadvertently and unintentionally, my previous sneakers all have mesh tops, which lets them hug the foot more. That gives them all a smaller profile around my foot, which I came to like unknowingly. These, being of thicker material, will have a boxier and fuller look. That's fine; just making aware.

I've taken them on my mountain bike with very studded pedals & with minimal tears the to bottoms of them. The grip is great on all surfaces. They don't leave any scuffs marks on floors nor squeak after becoming wet. They can get dirty & be cleaned back to new with just a wipe. They don't really attract dirt so they are very easy to clean. Very comfortable & breathe great as well. They are light sneakers so long time spent on them bears no pain. The fit is very comfortable I have more of a  flat foot & they do not have a high arches that bother me. People with wide feet may even be able to wear these. One of my favorite cheaper sneakers for all around use. They are very abrasion resistant.

well I originally purchased the 12 regular and it was very tight around the outside of my foot.  I sent it back and ordered the double wide and they fit like a dream.  It feels like I am walking on clouds.  I am not sure why I did not purchase these sooner!  They are amazing.  I usually have inserts in the shoe as the soles of the shoes that I wear do not have enough cushion or support.  However these shoes are so comfortable that I did not put in the inserts as it has memory foam.  I have been wearing them for a few weeks now and they are fully worn in.  They are still the most comfortable shoe I have ever put on my foot.  They do not have much of a sole.  They are much thinner than the other shoes (Nike) that I have worn in the past. However, they are still so very comfortable.  Also they do not breath that well so I am not sure how I am going to like them in the middle of summer, but for now they are extremely comfortable.  Lastly, they do clean up well.  I have scuffed them up on shopping carts, kids stepping on my feet, etc.  A wet rag and they clean right up.

My Puma sneakers arrived yesterday. I have not worn them outside yet. What caught my attention was the style of the sneaker. The sneaker modestly stands out with its multi dimensional features on the external inner & out sides. The sneaker size may need to be ordered a half size (the first pair ordered was my actual shoe size & they were returned) larger than your shoe size.  My pair is the narrow & fits like a glove with tube socks.  It’s a comfortable fit light weight sneaker. I’ll make an effort to post another review after wearing them for more than ten hours. I’m hoping the sneaker will continue to perform exceptionally.

The sneaker looks great.  The problem is that it's tight at the toes.  Bought for my son who is 14.  He does not have particularly wide feet at all.  In fact he only weighs abouy 100 pounds.  Because they looked so nice, I was disappointed and not ready to give up.  I stuffed a lot of newspaper into the front of the shoe to try and stretch out the toe area.  This seems to be helping and my son has been able to wear the shoes.  However, as another reviewer mentioned, there is a crease that is already developing on the top of the shoe that goes around to the side.  :-(  Again, I love the way these shoes look, and after stretching them out my son says they are okay.  But really they need to make these with a bit more toe room.UPDATE:  So after wearing them a few days they have stretched out and my son says they are comfortable now.  I have revised from  to 4 stars.

Truthfully, The shoe did not meet my expectation. Although the shoe is a bit stylist, the shoe fit was not good, and did give the feel of a walking shoe. I did not send shoe back ( too much trouble).

I’ve bought the same style of sneakers 3 times and I love them, they're very comfortable and a great fit but they have all had the same issue after a week or 2 of running in them. They get a hole inside both shoes, right at the top of the heel, doesn’t go all the way through, but it goes through all of the cushioning. I usually have to add some moleskin inside otherwise it gives me terrible blisters on my heels.As I said, I love the sneakers, it’s why I’ve ordered them 3 times through Amazon, but potential buyers should know about this potential defect.

These are great everyday shoes, but I had to replace the insole to get some arch support.  The insole that comes with the shoe is flat as can be and is about 4mm thick...if that.  I'm not sure if I just have high arches or not, but there was nothing in there for support and they got painful quick.  A quick swap of insoles fixed that, and I can go 13+ hours a day with these shoes.

This is the best pair of sneakers I have ever had. the styling is good and the fit is amazing. We did originally by the correct size thought they were a little tight. so by A 1/2 SIZE BIGGER.

Wow what a great price for these sneakers!  My husband has been buying Puma sneakers for his last 3 or 4 sneaker purchases.  He really like the comfort and support Puma gives him.  I would say his sneakers get heavy use too between the gym and almost daily walking of at least 2 miles.  The Puma sneaker hugs your foot and gives it plenty of support without being too tight.  They are comfortable right out of the box with little needed break in time.  The cushioning and arch support are great.  He has had problems in the past finding sneakers that give him good cushioning and support so now that he has discovered Puma does, he has purchased several pairs of this brand.  Even though the price was low on this pair, there is no sacrifice in quality.I saw other reviews say they run small.  He got his normal size and they fit perfectly.  The quality of the material is very good.  He really likes the colors on this black and silver color scheme.  They will look good with not only gym shorts but also jeans.

I'm not really a runner. Most of my footwear are either hiking boots/sneakers (like Merrell's) or Work boots / Cowboy boots. I got these to start jogging in. For that they are pretty great. Only once after I just started jogging I had gotten some bloody toes right around my toenail but I think that was due to the fact that I'm not used to that type of exercise and a two mile jog might have been a little more that I should have started with. But that hasn't happened since.My only real complaint about these shoes are the shoe laces that come with them. They were way too small. I couldn't use all of the eyelets with the supplied laces. Leaving the last two open. I ended up needing to use laces closer to 55 Inches.I would recommend this shoe, but just keep note that you may need to buy new (longer) laces.

I know I have large feet, I wear a size 14 in most every shoe other than sandals. After I received these shoes as soon as I pulled them out of the box I noticed how narrow the shoes were but went ahead and tried them on. After putting these shoes on and walking around the house a little the toe box was already pinching my big toe and pinky toe and I knew if I tried walking any distance in these my feet would be extreamly sore.There is also little to no arch support but I didn't really buy these shoes expecting that to be good, though there really would not have been room for insoles and my feet in these shoes.

These are pretty comfy as long as you won’t be on your feet on concrete floors for 8+ hours. I bought these for my nursing clinicals and my feet hurt terribly by the end of my 12 hour shift.

I am a size 10 and have been looking for an all black Puma, couldn't find one and stumbled into the men's section.

I love this style of shoe for my HIIT workouts and weight training -I love them!From now on, I will always check for a men's equivalent if I cant find what I need in women's or want to compare prices. they look almost exactly the same.

I am very pleased with these shoes. Amazingly comfortable with the puma soft foam they're one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I've ever had and they look very nice. Pictures are after they've been worn for about 2 weeks, they have held up very nicely and I didn't even wipe them off for the pics. For the price this is just fantastic. All pumas run a little small so they might feel tight when you first put them on but they stretch right back out. Like I said they're probably the most comfortable shoes I own and the material makes them pretty durable but slightly vulnerable to scratches and scuffs. But overall I have to give these a five star review
"

Cheap material, I've worn them 3 days at work and they now look warped and damaged with a small crack forming on the outer layer of one of the shoes.  I walk maybe 15k steps a day at work as it's mostly desk work. Definitely not running shoes. Was expecting better from Puma. Idk.

I actually got these originally from another website because of the reviews - everyone said they were so comfortable.  After going through his 1st pair in about 3 months, I bought them through Amazon... a LOT cheaper than the original site.  My partner works in an auto shop, so he's standing/walking all day, from 7am to 5:30pm.  He has very large (13!), very flat feet.  So these not only cushion, but support his feet all day long, and they don't slip.  The cushioned sole helps bounce you, and there's less wear on your knees.  I had bought the wide ones originally, but it turns out those weren't good for him, and the normal width ones are actually more comfortable for him.  Now that he's on his 2nd pair, he's a lifelong user.

These shoes look great on me, and the soles are comfortable.  But after just a few weeks of wearing these to the gym I’m tossing them and buying better gym shoes.  The tongues don’t have a place to run the shoestrings through and thus they slip down uncomfortably.  Also, at the back of the shoe a metal strap inside the material sometimes moves out of place when putting the shoes on.  Overall, these shoes are a pain in the foot.

Seriously - DO NOT BUY THESE!!! I don't know who put the Puma logo on these cheap pieces of junk, but if Puma ever found out, I am sure there would be a lawsuit involved very quickly.  I have used Puma shoes for my whole life, and these are NOT PUMA SHOES!  The insole is completely different from what they use, the ""arch support"" is a cheap piece of plastic on the outside of the sole under the shoe, which does ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD FOR SUPPORT OF THE FOOT!  As for the fit, they were too long, and I have worn the same size shoe since I was 14, so I know that I need a 7 1/2, and these fit more like an 8 1/2.  The sole of the shoe has absolutely no support for any form of use in these shoes, not to mention that the ""synthetic material"" they are made of is so cheaply made, the shoes are cracked after only 6 hours of use.  I WILL NOT be purchasing ANY OTHER products from this particular site, and will be notifying the manufacturer of the known issues with this pair of cheap, imitation knock-off, pieces of junk.  Shame on Amazon for letting people sell junk like this on their website.

These look and feel great. The size is just right and they give my foot plenty of arch support and overall stability.

I love everything about this shoe- I’ve gotten several different colors/types.It definitely is a bit snug, so if you want to put any insoles in it make sure to get a slightly larger size. Wide size recommended if possible/needed- I wear 11 very regularly and I’d say these feel like 10.5.But the construction, durability, and flair of these is undeniable.

Had these about a week now. They're a bit ""snug"" in fit but not small.. more like a soccer cleat fit where they're snug on the foot for a good fit. My foot doesn't slide within them for sure.Looks are sharp (I got them in the black version), and the soles are very comfortable. Granted I'm coming off of about 2 year old Reeboks that were like work horses and are worn to death (but they just now truly came apart). Treads on these are nice and open so a bit easier to clean out if you do get mud or what not in them, which is a huge benefit for me for those times I sneak in the house with my shoes still on.Overall I like them.

If you work a lot on your feet with these on, they will begin to feel uncomfortable.

These shoes look fantastic. That's about the only positive thing I can say about them.Great looks, cheap feeling material and construction.The top and sides look and feel like cheap vinyl. The bottom feels like you're walking on a piece of semi flexible plastic (sounds like ot too).  I wore these shoes to work Friday, and then out for a bit of shopping after work. My feet felt about like I'd put in a 12 hour factory production floor shift in the cheapest Walmart steel toe boots. However, I have an office job and only had to walk across the warehouse one time that day.So, that's 8 hours in an office job, with one walk around the warehouse, a couple of hours of walking at Best Buy and Hobby Lobby and my feet hurt soooo much by the time I got home.IDK, maybe these shoes just aren't made for heavyweights. Maybe it would be a better experience for featherweights.I got them on sale for $35, but I think I would have been better off getting those cheap, tacky basic shoes at Walmart for $20. I wish I could refund, but it's too late now.

The shoe over all is pretty good. The only thing I don’t really like about it is that there is no loop for the laces in the tongue. I don’t know about anyone else, but when I wear shoes for more than just a little while, the tongue always slides off to the side of my foot so that the laces are against my socks…It’s a decent shoe if that’s not a problem for you. And if the shoe was made with a loop in the tongue for laces to hold the tongue in place, then that would’ve been great.

I wear a size 12 in basically every brand of shoes. The two exceptions being Converse and Toms. 11 and a half are perfect there. My foot is wider than average, but I’ve never had to order a wide shoe size. These Pumas are quality shoes, but narrow and short for a size 12. Very tight fit. Order a half size over your usual and wide option if you have wider feet! Otherwise fantastic shoes.

I once ran a 7 mile race in these.  Not with this EXACT pair, but the make and model.  I ran like the wind.  Not all the time, but most of the time.

The shoe looks great, fits great, and is pretty much perfect. The only complaint I have is that the memory foam insole is not that comfortable. I actually prefer the ""normal""  insole in my other two pairs of Pumas. They just feel better on my feet. While these shoes aren't horrible shoes, and I do recommend buying them for style and looks alone. I just don't find them to be very comfortable over a long day of wearing them. In my honest opinion, buy them if you like them. I just wouldn't wear them for more than 4 to 6 hours at a time.

The arch support is very good.  This is his second or third pair of PUMA sneakers and he has found them to be the most comfortable and also well made.  The materials are excellent quality and they hold up to wear and tear very well.  He has had one pair for 5 months and they still look almost new and are providing great support even after much use.  He has tried other brands but his feet get sore in them.  These also have a nice cushioned heel.  He seems to walk very hard on his heels and has heel pain if he doesn't have good shoes.  He got them in the white with gray/silver accents and they are very nice looking.  I would highly recommend these!

Without going into crazy detail, these shoes, for me, are arguably the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn of this particular style. The insert that comes with the shoes is amazing.. I usually wear Nike, have had Adidas, New Balence, Asics, etc. and I prefer these over all of those. I'll be getting another pair of these soon in a different color.

I have a normal width foot.  Width seems ok, but tight vertically.  I'm wondering if the wide model would be more comfortable.  I expect they will stretch a little and break in.  First time I've ordered shoes online.  I usually go to sporting goods store and try them on first.  I probably would have noticed and tried the W model had I tried them on first.

This is a great looking casual shoe. The fit is snug on my feet, but comfortable. I usually wear a women's 11. The 9.5 mens size is a perfect fit. Good for light exercise. The foam insert is nice, but these are not the most comfortable shoes. Good for every day wear. I would not use them for running, or anything where I needed a lot of extra support.

These shoes are nicely priced, fairly comfortable and sharp looking. This is my 2nd pair of Pumas and I'm beginning to figure out that Pumas fit small, so take my advice: If you wear a size10.5 US (like me), get 11's (or 1/2 size larger). And if you have wider feet, definitely purchase the wide size, if available. They seem to be a tad skinny in the width department.After this, all-in-all, I'm happy I bought these!🙂👍

As soon as I saw these shoes, I fell in love with them! The white and red combination looks absolutely beautiful and as soon as I got them, I had to put them on. The smooth texture all around the shoe gave me the assurance that this was a high quality shoe. These shoes are very comfortable, and I honestly love to wear them. They have a sole that is cushioned, so it feels like your stepping on something really soft. The sleek design and comfortable use made me very jubilant. I still have these shoes, and I still love them. I do wish that the ventilation on the shoes were better. The small holes that it has on the front of the shoe don't really provide a lot of air flow into your feet and could make your feet smell. If I go for a long walk, my feet will usually smell, but overall I'm really satisfied with this product and give it a 5 star rating!

I bought these just over 2 months ago to wear predominantly at work because I’m on my feet 8-12 hours per day. I deal with recurring plantar fasciitis, but haven’t had a significant flare up since I purchased these shoes. After a 2 month test run they are still very comfortable, provide great support, and allow decent airflow. I would’ve given 5 stars, but when I opened the box the first thing I noticed was a very pronounced purple hue on the shoes and laces that was no where near as obvious in the product image pic. I know that  periscope has hints of purple, but I was expecting  a much deeper shade of gray based on the picture.

I wear Pumas all of the time. The last two of these have issues with the tongues not staying in place. Thought it was a fluke last time and cut a hole in the tongue.

I like the look of this shoe but would not recommend it for training or tennis.  I will keep my pair though for casual wear. The memory foam insole is very comfortable and the shoe itself has a very clean look to it.  However, I was looking for a tennis shoe but after one match I knew these would not do. The leather is soft and doesn’t offer much support. The sole seems good and grippy though.  My toes took a beating though and for this reason I will not use these shoes on the court. I’ll look for a more robust cross trainer type shoe with more support.

These run small and are somewhat on the narrow side. I purchased my usual size 10 D and they fit like a 9.5 and very tight with wearing crew socks. I suggest sizing up at least a 1/2 size if not a full size larger if you plan to wear crew socks with these shoes. These also have a lower then average heel height. Please keep this in mind if you require arch support. These however are sharp looking sneeks.3/25/16 Update. As stated above, the Tazon 6 style sizing tends to narrow and small. I purchased another pair of Tazon 6 elsewhere in a size 11 and the size 11 fit perfectly and are quite comfortable. So my suggestion guy's, is ordering one size larger in this particular puma Tazon 6 style running shoe.

Fit well and are well made. I have had previous model of this shoe and liked them. I bought these and they are everything I expected. Comfortable and well made.

Great looking shoe. Does show dirt and scuff marks because of color. I have the Tazon 6 cross trainer in gray and it is a great shoe and great fit (size 10 1/2).

If I ordered again, I would stick to a size 10 with the  running shoe. Length is great.

Absolutely love these!!!!!! I get so many compliments!! The design is even better in person! They fit like pumas. If you've never worn pumas before I would suggest you going to a shoe store that sells them and try them on. Pumas fit differently. I'm normally an 8-8.5 in women's, but in pumas I'm an 8 in men's because they are tighter. They are a sports shoe, so that's how they're going to fit.

When I first put these on, I thought they were far too tight.  I don't know if maybe they tightened up too much with the chemical drying bags or what, but I thought I would have to return them.  However, after the first day, they loosened up and became quite comfortable.  In fact, they're one of the best pair of shoes I've ever owned (on par with Doc Martins).  The only downside is that the pair I ordered were all black, and mostly leather, so I wouldn't recommend them for hot days.

I got these because my other shoes were on their last legs and was thinking it would be cool to have a pair of trainers. That was until I got them, they fit but they can not handle water at all. I wore them to work and the moment they hit a slick surface they lost all traction with the floor. I was able to put my butt against a wooden door the weight of the door slid me from one side of the door frame all the way to the other. After a 4 or 5 hour shift my feet began to get just as sore in these shoes, as they do in my regular 30 dollar Walmart shoes.

Purchasing over internet, buyer beware!Without having a ‘dry fit’, using international sizing, these were tight width. I’m actually borderline Wide. To tight to be comfortable even for short periods of time.
"

First off, these were a true fit for me. I normally wear size men 10.5 in Reebok/Asics and these fit great, they are almost a perfect fit. They did take a couple hours to break in but the SoftFoam padding feels good on the feet. It's been a couple years since I've owned a pair of Puma's, mainly because of the price so I was happy to get these for $40. A con for these shoes would be the width for some people, I would say that my feet are a standard width but I always had to wear wides when I wore Nike's but I no longer like their style of shoes.Hopefully this helps someone.

I'm one of those people who likes to see how long a pair of shoes can last. And by last, I mean, how long until I literally can't walk with them anymore because they are either completely torn up or the soles are totally gone. Turns out, this is a horrible idea! Bad shoes = bad posture and bad back.I purchased these shoes because my last pair were Pumas and they lasted many years. The fit was great, and compared to incredibly old shoes it's like walking on clouds. If people could walk on clouds, that is. I'm sure they are soft. What I'm trying to say is that these shoes are awesome and they are comfortable. Great for walking, running, jumping, and swimming (just kidding, do not swim in them, just making sure you're paying attention). Great shoes!

Great shoe for walking and everyday use. The gel insert is very comfortable which makes up for the stiffness. I purchased these shoes a few years ago as a running shoe but immediately switched them to my everyday shoe. Definitely worth the price for well built, sturdy shoe. These pumas were advertised as a running shoe but don’t expect to run much in these, they are to heavy, bulky and stiff to use as a running shoe and may cause pain or injury but again, they are a very good walking shoe, that are very well put together unlike many Running shoes that will stretch or fall apart when they get wet.

My son absolutely loves these shoes. The shoe is more narrow than most other brands which is perfect for his narrow foot. The toe box is roomy but not too big. The support for a high arch is a little lacking but inserts correct that problem. The cushion support is comfortable and sturdy. The look of the shoe is sharp and athletic looking. He gets lots of compliments on them. Hopefully they wear as well as they look and feel.

Bought this shoe to use as a cross trainer. They don't have a lot of support. Felt like I had to tie them overly tight to keep my foot from moving around and even then, they weren't great. There isn't enough cushion along the whole sole. They only felt like the was real cushion around the heel. They look good, so I'll probably keep them for basic walking shoes, but definitely won't use them for working out or running.

Shoes are very comfortable compared to Nike.The leather is much softer and flexible. I typically wear a 12 in Nike, but since some of the reviews said that these run a tad small, I ordered on full size up to a 13.The fit in the 13 for me is correct.  I would recommend these shoes.

I bought my usual shoe size and they fit like a glove, though maybe I've just got wide feet, but these shoes are just a tiny bit tight on the sides, though as I wear them more often maybe they'll stretch a little to fit.Overall, they're comfortable, light, and the material seems to be quality stuff, so I'm definitely happy with my purchase though I got them half-off so maybe wait for them to be on sale because I think the normal price is a little steep for my wallet personally.

Bought these for weightlifting in my gym at the fire station. I wanted a pair of black neutral shoes, so the looks and styling is ok. I had been looking at them for a while, but when my cousin's husband had a similar pair at Christmas, and he loves his, I felt like it was a sign.These are heavy and stiff. If I plan on doing any serious cardio at the gym, I wear a different pair of shoes. If I wear these to workout and wear them the rest of the day, my feet are hurting by the evening. Let me stress, these shoes are not pliable. They would not be comfortable for running. I'm not a professional runner or even an avid runner, I'm not partial to running, but I've done my fair share of running for exercise.Would I buy these again? No. I prefer another brand and I'll go back to them from now on. I wouldn't even recommend these for regular use.

Feel more like clunky cross trainers than running shoes.Also, they look cool with the cat and all (that's why I bought them) but certain things like the tongue kind of folds weird when you lace it up.

These shoes look and feel amazing. The inserts are very soft and are great for my feet as standing on my feet causes me pain if done for extended periods of time. With these shoes on, I have no problems and my feet never feel worn out. Easily one of the best shoes I've ordered. I knocked one star off because I accidentally bumped the corner of a wall leaving a room in my house and that small bump put a dent in the front of my left shoe.

I've had these for about 5 months now and they work great! The cushioning works well for me and I work in a factory with concrete floors.

As my second pair of Pumas these worked well.I have narrow, flat feet. Size 10 worked well for me.My only complaint is that the tongue likes to slip to the side in ONE of the shoes when I slip them on. It didn't do that with my last pair and only does it with one shoe. Kind of annoying.

I bought one 3 years ago but in different color. Admittedly, they too were bigger then my true size. This time I needed different color but same model so I ordered smaller size.I was so bummed I had to return them because they were to large and they don’t have smaller size 😢

My shoe size is 10 1/2 when l ordered the shoes from you all l ordered half size bigger size 11 that way l knew l could use them. A little too big is ok. Well the new shoes size 11 too small. This shoe runs a size small 11 is 10 and so on. I know what size shoe l need.What l didn't know is this shoe runs a size small but no big deal.

I have the EXACT same shoe, but it's all black. I bought them locally. The size 14 is a little more roomy than I like but it's fine. THIS shoe, however, is much smaller and tighter. It feels like a 13. The leather is thinner and the cuts aren't near as precise as they should be and the insole is just a slab of memory foam, whereas the locally purchased shoe has a nice sole/midsole THEN it has a fancy insole with a little arch support and a padded heel.They literally look like Chinese fakes. That's how bad they are. I emailed Puma and got no response. Amazon just says send them back. They didn't even care that they were basically cheap copies. 🤷🏼‍♂️

Cool looking and comfortable shoe. I really wasn't expecting to be so happy when I saw them come in the mail but I certainly got what I payed for. Once I put them on I could run faster, longer, and jump higher. I challenged Usain Bolt to a race and I won! I won! Then I went back and beat all of those kids I lost races to in Kindergarten and watched them cry as full grown adult. I then proceeded to walk around town and all of the girls just had to stop and stare as I passed by, they just couldn't get enough of the sneaker. All in all, I would have to recommend these shoes to everyone I know, mostly because of the badass that they have turned me into.Results may vary.

We are now having to resort to buying shoes online for my son, since majority of our local stores do not carry shoes in his size.I am very pleased with the speedy 2 day shipping with Prime.My son said the shoes fit great! They are not too tight or big on the sides & feel comfortable! He doesn't feel like he has to ""break them in"" like his previous shoes.Upon inspection the shoes look durable & they may actually last until we have to buy his next pair.The other thing that caught my eye to purchase this particular shoe was the price! An AMAZING deal for the style, brand & size. My son has grown so quickly that we are buying new shoes every couple of months so this price was easy on the pocket book.

Arch support is decent but their a little snug on the toes. A tad bit on the noisy side. Clump a lot like boots sometimes. After wearing these shoes for some time I wouldn’t recommend them.

This shoe is comfortable as a general workout shoe, or for occasional runs of a mile or two.  There are other shoes better-suited to frequent or long runs.  One intangible - they look good.

I have bought over 10 pairs of this exact style at different times and years. The first 6 pairs where exactly the same, after that I noticed a slight change  bit by bit, the change was taking place, quite small to notice at first, but the last I purchase was definitely drastic. The material feels like it was made with the least expensive rubber band available. I loved this shoes so much this was going to be my set for life, but now ""NO MORE"". Quite upsetting. The support is horrible, I wear them for 1 hour and my feet hurt for 24 hours after that, I rather walk bare feet. I wish I could get a refund but I guess is too late.

If you are looking for all black work shoes, look no further. Seriously comfortable soles and tough on outsides. The soles feel like small plush pillows in your shoes. The design looks nice, very clean cool look to them. Not made for running or athletic use because the outside material is pretty tough and doesn't have much flexibility to run or workout in them. If your feet run wide don't get them, pumas run narrow towards the toe. I also read people having issues with them running a half inch smaller which I agree they do but they didn't have a half inch size up option so just get your normal size, should be fine.

I personally hate how 99% of all running shoes look. I know appearance has nothing to do with function but could it really hurt for companies to come out with better looking shoes? These are one of the few running shoes that I actually like the way they look. I can wear them anywhere with anything and look good in them. Way to go Puma!Most importantly though these feel great. They fit like a glove on me (size 12) and are very light. I recently ran a 5K in these and my feet felt great. No signs of them wearing out and they seem very well built. Will look to Puma running shoes for my future purchases.
"
5628,"
I have been using this for a couple of months now and the shoes have gotten more comfortable over the period. They arrived a snug fit for my size even when I have been using a standard PUMA shoe size for years. However, as compared to earlier Puma shoes that I have these seem to be on lower side for performance and quality. The insole of the shoes has already worn out in my 2months of use for aerobic activities of about 3hours everyday. I would recommend buying a better brand if performance is the prime reason for buying these.

I have been buying 3 pairs per year for a few years now...these last ones feel like clown shoes!  I will not buy them again.  They now have some sort of thicker insert inside to make up for the changes they made to the shoe structure.  I feel clumsy and floppy every time I get up and start walking.I will now be faithfully buying a different brand.  I hate when a company cuts corners on one of their top products...WHY DO YOU THINK IT WAS RATED A TOP PRODUCT IN THE FIRST PLACE?!  IT WASN'T JUST BECAUSE THEY LOOK NICE.

This is the 2nd pair of Puma running I have owned. I like the fit and the style. The shoe holds up to normal wear and tear and can be wiped clean to continue looking new. The shoe isn't really flexible to expand for a wider foot, so keep this in mind when choosing your shoe size. It does saying running shoe, but I dont use these shoes when jogging and prefer a lighter  shoe with more cushion in the heel. A great shoe for relaxed weekends.

Soo I bought these because they looked good and were a great price. I regret buying them. I am a heavier guy but trying to get my steps and walks in. OMFG!! The blisters that form EVERY time I go walking on the ball of my feet are massive and HURT. The memory foam soles were a great touch when I first put them on. I was super excited about having a memory foam sole. Theyre great for sedentary life but yes they do seem to fall apart. Ive had them for about 2 months and they look like they're 2 years old at this point. I have plenty of other awfulness about them but Ill skip all that just like you should skip this purchase and move on to a nice set of Nike's. These shoes are rubbish.

I had searched high and low for Puma sneakers for my husband, and he couldn't be more pleased with these!!  I've always known Puma to fit a bit narrower than your average tennis shoes, so keep that in mind if you are a first time buyer of Pumas.  My husband has more narrow feet for a guy, so these shoes really do fit like they were made for him.  He has worn them regularly...nearly daily since April, and they have held up wonderfully!!  That is after hiking SEVERAL miles in them in all conditions too!  Great support for the arch and cushy overall on the soles!
"
5643,"
As with all shoes, they were tight to begin with. After giving time to wear in they have performed well. The one thing I have noticed is they run a little large. I wear a size 12 but probably could wear these in size 11.5. I wear these as my daily shoes and have normal cotton socks, but when I have worn them for workouts with thinner socks they are big. It is a little annoying but nothing major. Since these are my daily sneakers it is not something I worry about. If I used them for workouts regularly then I would go for a smaller size.

Now I know why they sell the shoe in both medium and wide, in all sizes, as these run narrow.  I should have ordered a wide which likely would have fit like a medium.  Length wise they fit perfect.  Hoping they stretch a little as the box got thrown out, so no returning them for a wide.  Arch support is on the low side, but acceptable.  Otherwise, great shoes that are solidly constructed.

I LOVE Puma's and my boyfriend who has been joining me in a lot of my workouts was in need of a new shoe so I got these as a gift and now he LOVES them. We go for 3-4 mile walks daily, some jogging, lots of fitness classes such as circuits/boot camps with lots of cardio and jumping and these provide perfect amount of arch support. He was also cursed with totally flat feet and these help with that as well.
"
5659,"
Was on the fence between classifying as ""somewhat small"" or ""fit as expected.""  Why? Well, they are somewhat narrow, but in my experience most Puma running shoes are a bit narrower than other brands.  So if you are not familiar with the Puma fit, it may feel tight to you.  But if you are a Puma regular, it ""fits as expected.""  A little too shiny out of the box for my usual taste, but that goes away with wear. I bought these because so many other running shoes have mesh or fabric down towards the soles which just get soaked through walking on wet pavement which make my socks wet quickly. Not a problem here!

It’s really hard to find a good shoe without goofy designs and colors anymore. I just want to gray shoe and no neon colors. Finally found that with this pair of Pumas. They fit great and are very light weight. They are gray so they should hide the dirt and look new for a good amount of time. I just need to make sure I put my old she’s on when I decide to mow the lawn or do some painting around the house. However, if I do forget to change them I’ll know right where I can go to get another pair!

This is my third pair of this exact shoe - loved the first two pairs. This latest pair is different though. The shoe tongue is too short on this pair and after wearing them for an hour or so the tongue slides down and becomes very uncomfortable, necessitating me to completely undo the laces enough to pull up the tongue and try to tie it tight enough to help - can't be stopped though. Very obnoxious.  Why they would change this from the previous cuts is odd.
"
5664,"
Great walking shoes if you have flat feet. Excellent arch support, seems to make me roll off the practically non existent ball of my foot. The foam setting around the heel can wear out quickly but they generally hold up well. This is my third pair, I'll be sad when they stop making them.

This is my 2nd pair. First know they run small, I take a size 9 but with these I have to take an 11. I wore my first pair down, wearing it every day for like 4 months.

I still like narrow toed sneakers, I think they look better on my foot, but they're so hard to find these days.  With the Tarzons I have the narrower toe than most sneakers and they are indeed comfortable and stylish enough to wear to casual events.  I like them so much that I own four pairs now in various colors.  The only downside, more of an observation than complaint, is the tongue shifts to the side at times, no lace loop to keep it in place.  Other than that, it is a wonderful shoe!
"

I just got these and I really like them a lot.  They fit as expected and look smart!  I've been wearing them around the house and they feel good.  I still need to work them (i.e. walking/biking, etc.), but my initial impression is positive.  For years I've worn Asics, but I wanted a change.  I tried Nike and was horribly disappointed.  I know, I l know...they all make a zillion styes and there is probably some in each brand range that I would like.  That said, I wanted to try a new style and brand.

Was a little tight around the toe area, but the sneaker has now relaxed and is comfortable to wear. It did not take long to break in. Has a memory foam insole, which makes it very comfortable.

Got these for weight and plyometric workouts.  Very good for squats, leg press, etc.  these are categorized as running shoes.  I would not use these for running; too tight and heavy for my preference. However I do like them for gym workouts.  These are stiffer than my running shoes.  When doing box jumps - they feel heavy and does not flex.  These are narrow and therefore provide good stability for squat - leg press type of exercises.

For a guy dealing with plantar fasciitis for a few decades, this shoe can be worn without orthotics, as the heel when  seated in the trainer, is so secure.  There is fine support from toe to heel.  I have already purchased a second pair.  I am fast becoming a Puma fan.  They have done for me, what other big brands could not.  Bravo!

I bought these because I liked the style.  And that's the last nice thing I can say.  These are hands down the most uncomfortable shoe I can remember wearing.  They are as flat a pine board with an insole that feels just like the sponge I have on the kitchen sink.  If I had to do a bit of shopping for an hour or so, I could manage in these shoes without dying.  Walk a couple miles for pleasure?  No.  Work one eight hour shift on my feet?  Not without a week vacation and two foot transplants afterwards.  Anything more than idling in a chair reading a book while wearing these shoes is an act of contempt for one's own feet.  I have about ten hours in these torture devices and then I gave up, my knees and back couldn't take it.  If you have flat feet, was a grunt in the Army, or just hate your feet in general, good luck to you sir.

Pumas are always gonna run slim. If you have a wide foot Puma like a few other brands should be avoided.  For me I’m normal width but I knew these were only for style in the gym for weights and elliptical.  Since they are all leather, you need to break them in.  Think about a cockpit!  You will sit in there, be snug but still able to move a little.  That’s what these are. But overall it’s been a few months and they work well for me.

This is our third pair as my son's feet grow. We found them first at a local store then ordered the others on-line over time. He wears them all-season everywhere.

This is my 3rd pair of these same shoes over the last few years and for whatever reason these are not working as well as the last 2.

I like Puma shoes.  I have a narrow flat foot, but these shoes still fit me good.  They are a very good value and are not made in China!  They are made in Vietnam.  Not a great fan of Vietnam, but better than China.  They are made well and look very nice.

I absolutely love Pumas. I love the look of this shoe. BUT the toe box is very narrow. I am a woman, but wear a size 10.5 so I often buy men's shoes for work. The toe box of this shoe is narrower than my sneakers and boots that are in Woman's sizes. Very sad.

These Puma sneakers are amazing from the second I put them on. The soft foam optimal insole is soooooo comfortable. They are stylish without being over the top. It's been awhile since I purchased the Puma brand but I took a chance because I like the style. I will check out others in the future. At this price point they would be hard to beat.

This is a good shoe for wearing around the house, but I can't wear them if I am wearing athletic socks.  They are too tight in the toe box and pretty snug everywhere else.  I never had a problem with this with Brooks, Adidas, or New Balance athletic shoes.  So with that said, I wear them as house shoes, and they're very comfortable.  But if I want to wear socks, I'd have to order one size bigger I think.
"

This shoe is really nice and sleek-looking, but the toe box seems narrow.  Also, there's no ventilation. As for comfort, there's very little cushioning in the sole. After wearing them for about 3 hours, I had to take them off because the balls of my feet were so sore. It's a cute shoe, but not the most comfortable.

These shoes are a tight fit, but not too small so it ended up working well for me.  The sole is well padded comfortable, my feet are never sore from walking or running.  I personally find them stylish with the way the logos and highlights are designed.  Just remember they do run a bit tight so keep that in mind if you have very wide feet.Saw some reviews about how these shoes get dirty.  Are you serious?  These are running shoes, of course they'll get dirty.

I bought 3 pairs of this red white and black model Pumas that lasted 5 years so I know a little bit about them. I also have a gray and white pair that are nice too. They used to be a great shoe. That's why I bought 4 pairs in the last 6 years. I still use 2 of the pairs. When I put on my old pair bought years ago they are way better than my newest pair. They changed the look a little bit too on the new red and whites but that's actually OK, I like it. I'm not happy with the changes they made to the comfort and feel of the shoe. This latest pair is poorly made and uncomfortable. It feels like a cheap pair of sneakers now. They are clunky and awkward and the sole feels flat so I wont be buying and Pumas again. I'll go back o Nikes or Reeboks.
"

Great shoe at a great price, slightly snug feel, but not truly size altering. I may have gone for a half size larger than I did, but overall very satisfied. I work at a building that processes a lot of blood, so I find it hard to find an all white shoe made of a material that can be easily wiped off, thankfully this fits the bill!

Overall, I like this shoe. Initially, it was very snug (which I attributed to my size: 6'4"" 255 lbs). After about 10 minutes of wear, it loosened up nicely. The insole is very comfortable. I don't like the  shiny heel wrap, and had I noticed it before purchase, I might have chosen something else. I'mglad I didn't, though. I like this shoe and, depending on how it wears, I would buy it again.

I bought this pair of Pumas for my dad and he loves them. The fit is perfect, however I ordered one size up for more room in the toe box. The running shoe has a round toe design and my dad prefers a roomy fit.  Otherwise, the design is sporty, the fit is comfortable for running or walking, and the color white is brilliant; older gents love white athletic sneakers lol.  The package arrived earlier than expected. Thank you Amazon and Puma my dad appreciates your good products and services.

The most comfortable shoe I've owned in a long time. Excellent fit, perhaps a little snug. Normally my feet will get a little tired with most shoes after a long day on my feet but not once have my feet hurt with these shoes. Good grip on the sole. Very good foot and ankle support. Very reasonably priced overall and a lot of color variations. Very clean classy look. Would definitely recommend to anyone!

I bought these sneakers in july of this year (2021). I have worn these just to walk around not to do any exercise or anything like that. And yet today I looked down and see that the leather/pleather has split over my right pinky toe. You can clearly see a hole in the shoe on the picture I am not happy at all and would love a refund. UPDATE--10/19/2021 I was told by AMAZON staff that because the return date  was well past the 30 days. They would not refund my hard earned money and that I was told to COMPLAIN TO THE MANUFACTURER. So I did that and sent a kindly worded email explaining my situation to puma. I have gone 3 business days without a single response.  I was a loyal fan of puma sneakers for 7 plus years  but after the blatant disregard and lack of recognition from them I WILL NOT BUY A SINGLE THING FROM PUMA EVER AGAIN and I urge you to stay far away from this particular type of sneaker and from PUMA in general.

They look great, and are very comfortable. They also fit as expected. The thing is, there is practically 0 ventilation with these shoes. I work 12 hour shifts at the hospital, and my feet smell horrid after taking these things off.They're great for athletic shoes, or something to be worn for shorter periods of time, but you will have some nasty smelling feet if you wear them beyond that.

These are one of the best shoes I have ever owned. I bought these shoes for walking and its comfortable so I ended up using in my world travel. These shoes are not meant for hiking but I used them (they do not perform well as hiking shoes). My point is I have used them in all sorts of environments and they have lasted me a over a year. I have use these shoes in Glaciers in Norway to mountains in Argentina to daily use at home. I love them!

This is a great looking running shoe, if you happen to like the lighter shoe colors, as I do. Support is good, although the shoes do keep my feet a little warmer than I would like. This pair of shoes served as a replacement for my worn 10 year old Nike Air Max. Let's see how it performs...

The reason behind the 3 out of 5 is because the foam inserts wasn’t glued down and slip out every time I remove my feet from the shoes.Also had random stitching that I had to cut in the toe area to slip my feet into the shoes.I also noticed the stitching going around the left shoe is loose so we will see how long the shoes last.The hassle of returning and getting another pair is the only reason I’ve kept them. Wanted to order another pair if this pair fit right but I’ll probably looked elsewhere.
"

This is my first pair of Puma's ever and like most, I've been wearing Nikes for decades. These are nice looking shoes but they are a little narrow and require a little breaking in, especially the left foot which the shoe was rubbing my ankle. I would give 4.5 due to having to break them in.

I WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN!! NEVER! did I say NEVER!!

The price was right so I overlooked some of the comments. I have only worn them a few times and so far the fit is perfect, the looks great and I almost bounce in my walk.  I am however partial to Pumas. At my age, all I can do for exercise is walk and a little lifting.  Walking in these have been a great experience.  I had just bought Filas for a higher price and far less quality. wish I had returned them!

I weigh 300lbs so I go through shoes about every 3 months or so.  I bought these about 3 months ago and they still feel and look like brand new!  I am very impressed with them.  I have high arches which are supported just enough.  I will say they probably wouldn't be great for running, but I wear them as a daily shoe at work and in the evenings and they are great for that purpose.  I like them so much that I just bought a 2nd pair to have on hand when this pair gets worn out.

I purchased these a half size larger due to everyone's reviews stating they fit a little small.  I normally wear a 10.5 and got these in 11 and they're actually about a half size to big for me.  This is my first pair of Puma's and so far i'm pretty happy with them as my work now allows these types of athletic shoes with our business casual attire.  Shoe's have a nice comfortable fit, look great and were just what I was wanting being all black.  I can deal with the half size to big, I just tie them a little tighter.

For the price, they're solid shoes for someone with flat feet. The break-in time is roughly a week, or 25 miles worth of walking. I'd recommend bringing a second pair of shoes with you so that whenever the Pumas begin to hurt your feet you can switch, to give your feet a break until you break them in.They aren't the most comfortable, as the ""Soft foam comfort insert"" isn't all that comfortable; another gel insert would help. But once you've broken them in, they offer solid support; I've noticed that my knee and lower-back pain has diminished, which is always a plus!All in all, I'd give the shoes a 3.5 out of 5; good shoes to beat around in for work if you know you're gonna mess them up.

My ordinary shoe size he is nine and a half to 10. This shoe is extremely tight and narrow. It is definitely not true to size. I would have like to have exchanged the shoe for a full size larger to an 11. However, there would be a price increase involved up from $35 to $59.94. I tried to take care of this through ""chat,"" but was not successful in reaching a satisfactory conclusion. Somehow or another I got bounced off of the proper website to continue.

I've had issues with Puma Shoes in the past as far as sizing. They seem to size smaller than normal My shoe size is a Mens 10 1/2 (US) and when I bought another pair of Pumas 4 years ago they were really tight when I bought them in my size. With these Tazon 6's I bought them a size larger than I needed (Mens 11 1/2 US) and they fit me perfectly.

Excellent shoes, I love this model and have bought  it many times, good quality. The reason I said I have bought it many times it’s because I have a discrepancy between my two legs so my shoes get worn off unevenly so I usually use a pair of shoes not longer than three months, however this model and brand are very very well made and it last me almost 6 months, for those who need a nice looking shoe, comfortable, and need a strong support to not tweak your ankle, great option!

Gave this product 3 stars based on looks alone.  I ordered my normal size but these sneakers are just plain uncomfortable.  I’ve try putting shoe trees in them to try and stretch them but so far they are just not comfortable to wear for any period of time. Problem is not in the length, it is more in the lack of comfort with the insole and across the arch.  Maybe it will get better with time,  but for now, they are certainly not my go to sneaker for comfort.

This product would have gotten 5 stars if they had fixed this one design flaw.

I thought I just got a bad pair so I sent them back and requested a replacement. The replacement shoe’s tongue still slips in the new pair. I have never had a pair of shoes do this.

The only reason why I am buying a 2nd pair because my shoe was subject to my little niece putting a knife through my first pair (don't ask). Otherwise the shoes have lasted roughly two months and were a great purchase.

The toe portion is really wide and loose. Even someone with wide feet will complain. The heel is lower than the toe so it feels like you're always walking uphill. No arch support. The look is a reminder of Nike Shox, but no where near the quality. The rubber in the toe was wrinkling after 3 hours of wear. Sent both pairs back immediately. Got a white and black pair. Neither of them fit like regular shoes. Didn't realize Puma was such a low quality brand.
"
5855,"
So I tend to rebuy this style of puma because I love how they fit and feel in my foot. They also last quite a while as I use them daily for work (medical field). My only surprise was that I thought I was buying a black pair, and they were act it actually dark grey. They are very nice, just not what I thought what I was originally ordering. Won't return them though because again, they are some good looking shoes.

My 10yo son wore these for only two months. While cleaning them, I discovered BOTH soles were completely worn through! Obviously they did not go back on his feet after this discovery. I have never seen this in ANY of his shoes - this must be either defect or very sub-par quality. Recently bought Pumas for myself and I hope this will not be the fate of those as well. Will not be buying Pumas again after this.

When I first put these shoes on I thought they were uncomfortable and tight.  After walking in them for about a week I can say they are very comfortable with great cushion.  I don't run a lot but I walk many miles a day and these shoes feel like much more expensive running shoes.  I wear shoes out quickly.  Only time will tell how they'll wear and I'll update my review.

Returned because they were too small (12"") and I needed 12.5"" which wasn't available at the time of my order. Very good looking pair of shoes. The only concern about the shoes is that the insoles were not removable; which would be fine except that I wear orthotics in my shoes and I've found in the past that my orthotics work better under the insoles.

I am a 13 slim yet these Puma's fit snug on my feet and feel like they are part of my body. They look sharp and feel great to walk in on my treadmill. I do not use these outside as they are specifically for walking 3-6 miles per day on my treadmill. I definitely enjoy these and given my foot is narrow, I would caution buyers with thicker feet to be careful. These were perfect for me however!

Ordered these for my boyfriend who was literally wearing old sneakers with holes in the toes. When he first put them on he wasn’t sure if he liked them or if they were comfortable enough.

It’s the first time he’s come home from work in three years and his feet haven’t been in pain.

I like Pumas because they are made for narrower runner type feet. These are sharp looking shoes. One thing I did knock a star for, why I returned them- there is some puckering when you take a step on the inside of the arch- I was concerned these could get worse over time and really I was buying these for the look. I had another 2 pairs of Pumas over time and loved them, these seem a 1/4 size too big in comparison to those though.
"
5885,"
I have been buying these exact shoes for almost 5 years and my most recent pair will be my last Puma product. If you notice all the positive reviews are old if you asked me 2 years ago if I would recommend these I would yell yes. But they recently changed the materials and manufacturing process they use to make the shoes and quality has tanked. My pair before my most recent I noticed the drop in quality but it wasn't enough to completely sway me, but my most recent pair has been a nightmare. My last pair lasted about a year but did show signs of wear before that, but the pair I just bought didn't even last a month before falling apart and I can feel how much cheaper they are made now. If you value your money stay away from these. I used to be extremely loyal to the puma brand but clearly, they don't care anymore so neither do I. What a disgrace to the company.
"
5886,"
Decent shoes.  Not surprised of my dislike for them, knowing the price.  Fit well and decently comfortable.  Profile is too low.  Wont buy again but I'll rock' em til they fall apart..which would most likely be within a few months.  Good for restaurant workers n such jobs alike. Not good for the rugged and wild.

Fit size is bit larger than nike,  really like the outside of the shoe,  very well constructed and nothing plastic.  The in-sole is not that great.  Not much cushion and is already starting to come out when taking off the shoe.
"

I only wore these to work for a desk job and the glued on soles of both shoes is coming apart after a month of very light use.  This is annoying because when you drive you can feel the heel part of the shoe separated and on the front part of you walk thru grass it gets caught in the front part of the sole that's separated.Would not again. I've had Nike, Adidas and new balance shoes last much longer and still held together.

I’ve worn pumas for about 3 years now and loved them. I walk about 10-15 miles a day and go through shoes quickly. When I used pumas the first time I thought it wouldn’t last, but it did. Outlasted the adidas, Nike’s, saucony, and new balance that I had tried.

I purchased these (size 12) because I ordinarily wear 11 1/2 Narrow (B) and several reviewers said they were a bit small and too narrow.  Also, I refuse to pay $100 ++ for shoes to be used primarily for outside chores. The padding and arch support are adequate; upper materials are somewhat stiff so break-in period has been a little longer than expected. I've worn these shoes a few days per week for about three months now. They are showing no sign of premature wear. and I'm increasingly happy with them as time goes on.  Overall, these are an option worth considering for those who (1) find many Medium (D) width shoes too wide, (2) appreciate good value, and (3) care not a whit about celebrity endorsements.

I purchase these old school Pumas for myself in men’s’ size 6 as they didn’t have a ladies 7.5 available. They are narrow and snug so I’ve had to slowly break them in. I didn’t care for the white shoelaces so I ordered navy blue laces and I think it improves the look. The leather is high quality and I love how they look. If your feet are super wide, you may not like these shoes.

I purchased these (size 12) because I ordinarily wear 11 1/2 Narrow (B) and several reviewers said they were a bit small and too narrow.  Also, I refuse to pay $100 ++ for shoes to be used primarily for outside chores. The padding and arch support are adequate; upper materials are somewhat stiff so break-in period has been a little longer than expected. I've worn these shoes a few days per week for about three months now. They are showing no sign of premature wear. and I'm increasingly happy with them as time goes on.  Overall, these are an option worth considering for those who (1) find many Medium (D) width shoes too wide, (2) appreciate good value, and (3) care not a whit about celebrity endorsements.

They run small -- go a half size up. I am typically a US women's 8 / men's 6.5 / Euro 39. I find that if I order shoes using Euro sizing which is determined by actual length (you can find charts that convert Euro size to centimeters) the fit is more accurate than going with US sizing. The Puma size chart shows Euro 39 corresponds with US men's 7 which is what I ordered and these fit me perfectly.I got the gum sole in white/gold and love the styling. These are more contemporary and sporty looking than most women's white sneakers which can sometimes look like bulky nursing shoes. The quality of leather is good and the construction is good. My only complaint is that after one wearing, the gold foil logo imprint on the foot bed inside one of the shoes started to peel, which is to be expected and not really an issue as this remains out of sight when wearing, however, a printed foot bed would have been appreciated for better esthetic wear. Also, there is a little glue residue around the toe where the gum sole meets the leather. The stitching is excellent.The first time I broke these in I wore them for a whole day while working on my feet and didn't experience any fatigue or aches. Comfort wise, they're not bad, no issues with rubbing and not stiff, however not as comfy and low profile as my favorite Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 (yep, the yellow Uma Thurman Kill Bill ones!), but these are half the price. I would say the Romas are moderate to very good and will get even more comfortable as the leather softens with wear. The arch support is good too.  The grip on the sole is great and the shoe has an average degree of flexibility.I love them and am glad to have the Roma Classic Gum in my rotation for a moderately low profile leather sneaker. Versatile and sporty and good for wearing with jeans, shorts, leggings, or casual dresses. I do wish that Puma would bring back the Aiki Cat slip ons (no laces), but these are a decent alternative within the brand.

I use these treadmill and lifting weights.  I use my Asics for squats and these for upper body workouts.  Theses are like my Nike Cortez's except they have a leather tongue instead of Nike's stupid nylon one.  The leather tongue is very luxurious and puts Nike to shame which makes me sad because I like Nike.  I wear these with Puma shirts as to match and so far okay but they need dark navy Puma logos instead of off blues and sissy girl colors like candy or windows 8 start menu.I used to like Puma Suede's but last pair hurt my feet after walking on sidewalks for long amounts of time.  I am not sure why that happened.  Seemed weird like they used to be more comfortable.  Maybe I got a bad pair.Had/have a pair of Puma Dallas I never wear because they are too loose in the width and about 1/2 or more too long.  They slip off the heel when running no matter how tight I lace them (which makes them look long and too skinny and just funny) and they wiggle when I squat which is dangerous and annoying.  The low heel is nice but who cares if it wiggles, how can I lift confidently with wiggle?Puma whirlwind had stupid nubby outsole which looked like dumb golf cleats and worse hurt my feet when I was walking to the mall and in the mall.  On hard surfaces the nubs make a funny noise and people stared at me obviously amused by my choice of footwear.  They click clacked on the hard tile so not good choice for out and about activities.  Maybe sprinting on clay track or grass turf.  Stay off concrete/asphalt/indoor surfaces.The G. Villas seem nice tennis shoe comparable to my Kswiss Classics so I might try them but I do not need tennis shoes right now.  If I did I would rather G Unit Reebox's.The speed cats piqued my interest some time ago but I was not sure if the sleek styling was suitable for casual wear, too European.  I could definitely see the value as sports trainers am I really liked when the outsole was good year rubber tire inspired.  Kind of like racing car slicker tires i.e. less tread more traction.  Now I am into working out more so these would be more appropriate for me as long as I did not combine the with no show socks as is a current trend.  I need coverage on my Achilles plus like wearing Nike quarter crews so you can SEE the logo.  No show's have logo on bottom of sock wear you can not see it, how stupid is that.All in all these are probably the best puma I have had not to low like the speed cats which would have to be purely sports trainers.  I can wear these with jeans and look cool like they are Adidas superstars or something.  Low shoes look bad with jeans unless you are bisexual and wear tight jeans or something.  I wear looser jeans so low shoes tend to be paired training shorts.  I can bench press with loose jeans and look normal.So these worked for the money , look good for casual, knocked off the Asics Corsair's/Nike Cortez but as least incorporated a leather tongue which should be almost mandatory, and are okay for sports and training.  Not hardcore running or atg squats but bench pressing, leg pressing, light track work etc.Update 8/9/2019:I just received a white with black stripe. They are not as good as the originals. They are lighter and cheap naugahyde. They had a scratch on one and the other was crushed. They are comfortable but not the quality I expect from a german brand. Very cheap chinese feel.

The Amazon picture don't do it justice!Now the negative: This was my first Amazon purchase and I wanted nothing more than a awesome experience buying exactly what I wanted and doing that from home. Unfortunately the right shoe has two glaring marks on it. On the back heel and on the left side. As a person that is use to buying in store, trying my item on before purchasing, this was very disappointing. A brand new pair of shoes should always look like a new pair of shoes. I debated returning them but not sure how well that would work. Now I'm feeling a bit gun shy on making a second Amazon purchase.

I like tight black leather shoes for city cycling. Can look and feel like a bike shoe with clips, but I can walk around with a normal looking shoe. Also important is a stiff sole that my pedals can grip. Since going vegan, it’s been tough to find and these are great. I’d love it if a gum sole with black “leather” was an option. Note: depending on the shoe, I wear 9.5 or 10, but these are definitely tight and narrow, and I had to return the original 9.5 for a 10, which is still snug, but the fit I like for cycling.

These are listed as Men's shoes, but they are perfect for us ladies too.  Several reviews stated shoes seemed narrow.

They look so good while wearing them that I bought another pair in another color.  Had hesitated for months on whether to make this purchase and now I am so happy I did.  I think I have found my favorite tennis shoe!

I bought these PUMAs based on their appearance and price point. I like the gum sole and wanted a white athletic shoe that had a subtle logo. I was not disappointed with any aspect of the shoes appearance. The fit however, for my feet, is not comfortable. I have a flat foot but can generally wear other popular name brand shoes in my size without difficulty. The second photo comparison is the black rubber sole of my New Balance 574s, which fit my feet great! The PUMA Roma’s fit very much like most of my Adidas tennis shoes (ie. very narrow insole and small toe box). I did not realize these Roma’s had that type of fit or I may have ordered up one size. I will still wear the new PUMAs because I like the way the look and wear them more for fashion than exercise. I’m hoping that with some wear, they stretch a little and better conform to my feet.

I work at an auto parts store, we are required to wear black polishable shoes. every other shoe no matter the price has fallen apart quickly. Dress shoes are not made to be durable or comfortable, especially when you are on your feet, in all sorts of weather conditions , ice,snow.... so when I found these, I was willing to try them because from previous experience puma shoes have been super durable. I have worn the shoes for 2 and a half months at work, and they still look new (even after I spilled brake fluid all over them), and feel just as good as day one. on any other shoes, by the first week they would be all scuffed up ( not these).I look forward to getting a lot more use out of them. And I am curious to see how much better they work in ice, snow, slush compared to dress shoes ive had since they have a really good grip. I will most likely be buying these again when someday they do wear out. Update, 9 months later and these shoes are still going strong, the soles are getting a little wore out and my feet hurt if I do alot of walking, but for the most part still do the job.The rubber on the sides are detaching a little and the bottoms are loosing tread. They do not take water and snow well at all it soaks it right up. (nothing some water proof spray cant fix)Update 2 Well they made it 10 months, and I honestly think if I had not of accidentally put a hole in the side of them from a sharp object that almost cut my foot open at work ( not anything the materials could have prevented, phenomenal synthetic upper) I could have easily gotten another month or 2 out of them buy just putting $1 soles in them. I am still really impressed since most the shoes I wear after work fall apart much quicker and I don't even wear them as much. I estimate that I got about 1800 hours out of these shoes! Now onto pair number two.

These fit beautifully, are a great casual shoe, and the price is incredible when you start comparison shopping for a decent shoe.The uppers are soft, the shoe is light, and the fit is comfortable. The first time I put them on, out of the box, was to try out how they felt around the house, and it was hard to tell I had shoes on my feet. That’s not an exaggeration and, yes, they were laced up.Arch support is good for me, but that's an individual thing.They are surprisingly quiet on hard floors compared to some of my other Pumas.I've only been wearing these for a couple of weeks, but I don't need more than that to tell if I like a shoe.In agreement with other reviewers you should go a half size larger when buying a Puma. I take a 10 ½ D (M) dress shoe, but my other Pumas are 11’s and they fit well.I’ve always gone with a Wilson tennis for work because sometimes I’m on hard floors for a number of hours and they’ve always given me good support and comfort. So I started out looking to replace my old Wilson Court Avengers, and after weeding out the hideous, those with few or no reviews, all the mesh uppers, and checking on brands I’ve worn before like Adidas, Etonic, and New Balance, I found myself looking at somewhere north of $70-$80 for a pair of kick around work shoes. I found nothing I liked that was reasonably priced (you notice how the price changes depending on your size) so I decided to check on Puma to see what they had and that worked out fine.The only nit I have is the tongue loop, the small twin cuts midway to 2/3 up the tongue that the laces run through to prevent the tongue from sliding into the shoe when you slip your foot in, is the Puma logo at the top of the tongue. I prefer the mid-tongue loop, but that’s an extremely small con to me compared to fit and look.

So I bought these for myself using the ""try it before you buy it"" option. I'll start by saying that I normally wear women's size 10 and got the men's 8 which is my usual fit.Esthetically these shoes are super nice looking. I bought them because I have now learned how to properly care for a pair of white shoes (go me!) and they reminded me of the ones Freddy Mercury wore.Off the bat the material of these felt suuuuper cheap, like they're knock offs or something. I have a pair of white leather Pumas and you can just tell those are quality shoes.My feet are fairly thin and I have never had a problem with ""regular"" (non-wide) shoes being too small or needing wide shoes. These ones, however, were incredibly tight on my feet despite fitting size/length wise. I honestly don't think sizing up would've helped but the cheapness of the shoe made me not want to find out.I did not buy it after I tried it. But thanks for the option Amazon!

I love Puma sneakers and I have purchased about 10 or so of them so far. I love these as they are very light and seem well built, however they are far too narrow and after wearing them all day my feet start to hurt. I usually wear a size 11 and I purchased an 11. I should have gone a 1/2 size or even a full size up. I never had such an issue with other Puma sneakers and I'm not sure why these seem to have such an issue. I wear them to work here and there but I would not wear them on a trip or somewhere where I would be walking all day as my feet would be killing me.Overall recommended as they are good build and very light. However make sure you get a size up, I wish I would have, but I'm making them work.***update***I liked these so much I purchased another pair in black. I went for a 1/2 size larger than usual and they fit better, however still seem a lit too narrow. But they look great and I get complements on them. I really like the fact that they are light and seem pretty tough. I do notice that whatever the black pair are made of (pleather), they seem to be very noisy and squeak as I bend and flex them.Over-all, a great pair of shoes as long as you get at least a 1/2 size larger and give them time to be worked in.

Item stated as leather - item is all synthetic.  Super tight width.  Concerned if I kept to try to break in the synthetic material would crack over time.

Great style and awesome shoes, first time I’ve ever owned a pair of pumas, I usually wear Nike’s or boots, I’m about 11.5 in shoes with a slightly wide foot and high arch, so the support is pretty good feel like I could run a few miles in them as I just finished a 5 mile walk. The reason I took this walk was to see if I could maybe help loosen the toe a bit. Didn’t work, my pinky started going numb on me, had to stop a couple times take the shoe off for the circulation. As one person said I don’t write this to discourage cause for the price it’s a quality product just get a half size up, if you got a wide foot maybe go a full size up. Too late to return them for myself but I guess I’ll just use them for those occasions where I know I won’t be walking much

I'm reliably a size 9 in pretty much every shoe. Some may be a bit loose or snug but I've never run into something as off as these things. I have shoes that are 8.5 which are snug but still comfortable. These things are on a whole other level. They seem about a full size smaller than indicated. The toe box is super pinched, tapers sharply which cramps your outside toes, and they seem too short as well. Looking at the size chart on the tongue it looks like they consider this a UK 8, US 9, and EU 42... which doesn't line up with any size chart I've seen elsewhere. Most have an EU 42 the equivalent of a US 8.5, which explains a lot. Even a half size up these would be a bit narrow but in a supportive rather than crushing way.If you have super narrow and not very tall feet, this is your shoe. There's nothing wrong with the construction and they look great. Unfortunately my feet can't conform to this shape.

Classic, clean, smooth, simplistic and beautiful. A stark contrast to the ""LSD trip"" styles of sneakers these days. I love the looks of the Roma's.That said, they are very stiff, and the leather creaks and feels cheap. I feel like they'll crack before long. I'm going to try some sort of shoe butter to soften it up. They fit VERY tight. I have skinny, long feet and with my normal arch support inserts i wear comfortably with ALL of my other shoes (about 14 pair)...but not these. There is very little top to bottom room, and the width is snug. I generally wear a 10½ - 11. I bought the 11 for these after reading the reviews. The length is just on the small side, but i think an 11½ would be too large. This makes for a shoe that feels like a part of my foot...which is good...but they also start to ache after a couple of hours. I hope they'll loosen up when they're broken in. Which will probably be never as i don't ever want to get them dirty.But...that's the price for fresh kicks i suppose.

Go a half size up. I ordered my size and the big toes hit the front when I stood up. Also, I must have a really narrow foot cause it was still a little wide. Just slightly. I didnt want to pull on the laces like if it was a horse in order to get the right width. Quite honestly, the only pair of shoes I had luck with were La Sportiva. Problem is, they are really freaking expensive but man, totally worth it. Not advertising for them, I have a pair. Also, I'm one of those ppl that wish ppl that comment on items give another recommendation for another product if they hate the one they are talking about. La Sportiva is the way to go.

Size 9 US  8 UK or 42 in Eur .. long and narrow. I can only wear them for a couple hours before the sides of my arches start aching. I do not remember Romas ever fitting like this. I am a big fan of retros my go to's are Nike Air Force Ones, Adidas Sambas, or Puma Romas,  The fit of these Romas remind me of Converse Chuck Taylors.  Long and  NARROW.. to narrow like I said I am a fan of retros you cant go wrong with a classic.. but these Romas fit like Chucks and there is a reason Chucks  are not on my go to list.  These Romas are damn near un wearable.  I wore them for about 4 hours around the house before I had to pull em off.  just that uncomfortable. and Wide wasn't an option so there goes $50 out the windowI would return them if I thought I could. I havent gotten in touch with the seller  probably ought to.

The Roma fits as it has traditionally in its normal, medium width for me. For those who aren't used to this particular model (synthetic), you will have to break them in for comfort. I do this statically (in one place), as opposed to the usual method of just walking, to better control where the creases occur.  This particular shoe as you may have guessed, is NOT for wide (not even moderately wide) footers or if you have any foot/toe problems though the length is spot on for my size.  I walk a lot, so I usually get the synthetic for durability and ease of maintenance (cleans fairly easily).  I also recommend putting them in a rotation as this model isn't breathable being a synthetic.

I would make this my go-to shoe if only they could produce a wide version in my size. I love the look and it’s an exceptional shoe from spring to fall. If you have long, narrow feet this shoe should be perfect. However, people with wide feet will find this shoe uncomfortable and might not even get their foot in. Ordering a size up won’t help either cause the length of the shoe is true-to-size.All in all, a solid deal when priced around $50

I normally wear a size 12. In Puma's, I always wear a size 13.These shoes are a similar design I remember as a kid back in the 70s. They look and feel good. I will be glad when I get some of the extreme brightness knocked off of them - they are an extra, super-duper shade of white!Buying shoes online is hit and miss, mostly miss. I would not have ordered these if I didn't already have a pair of Puma's at home with the prior knowledge that I always need a size larger than normal. You might get by with a half-size larger, but I have to go up 1 full size.I will say that, as with most shoes, these shoes look much better at smaller sizes. The farther you stretch out the design, the more of the appeal they lose; however, as I am getting older, I don't really care about being ""cool"" anymore. Get what you like and rock it with confidence and soak up the nostalgia.

A long time b&w Samba wearer, I switched to this classic Puma on a whim. Great looking shoe. I’m a solid 11 in almost every shoe. The 11 was a half  size too small. Tight in toe and width. The exchange was easy (not an Amazon seller, watch out when the size selection takes you out of Prime) thanks to both merchant and Amazon honoring the original listing as Prime. 11.5 works for me. A firm fit but comfortable.  They are breaking in nicely and I am very happy with them.

These shows are great to add a titch more style to an outfit than more typical sneakers, but they're still super comfortable.  My feet don't typically require tons of cushion or arch support, so i caution those with bad feet or those who run a lot to maybe avoid these.  I used to be a 50-60miles per week runner, and personally, i had to avoid these type of flattish-arched shoes or my feet would get sore / injured quickly.  However, for the couple miles per day I walk in the city these days (in these shoes) and the 10 miles i run per week (not in these shoes), they work perfectly.  Highly recommend

This shoe is a sharp “looking” shoe, live the color way the overall design is aesthetically on point. BUTTTT, it is the narrowest shoe I have ever owned. I have purchased Puma’s in the past and they were fine, but the Roma is retro design and super narrow especially the Toe Box. I am so disappointed because I was really looking forward to wearing it during the summertime. It’s a very clean profile I just wish it was a little wider. I have been trying to break them in. Hopefully I can loosen them up enough to wear. Length is fine Width Narrow, cushioning is good. If you have a narrow foot the Roma may be the shoe for your.
"

First off the soles are great. No real break in needed. The weight is deceptive, seems flimsy at first but the construction has held up. More of a kick around walking shoe than anything. Skateboarding and yard work, not such a good idea. Size is a little small by maybe an 1/8"" so no socks or a half size bigger if your toes go all the way to the end of your regular shoe. But all said I love the simple style and they aren't Nike.

I'm surprised by the comfort right out of the box - doesn't even need to be broken in!  Seems to run a bit narrow.  I do actually have a rather narrow foot, and this is snug in the toe box.

Product originally was too small. I wear a size 12 in multiple brands of sneakers but I had to return the 12s for 13s. No big deal and I received my money back when I dropped the item off at UPS-versus having to nag a company for my return money. That was sweet. Once I received the better size I gave them a try. The product is exactly how I expected as far as quality. The sizing though is a wee bit tight in the width department. Now I know I wear a wider shoe but these are still quite narrow. A size 14 would be way too big so I guess I have to stretch them out. This brings me to my next gripe which is in order to stretch them out I would need to wear them quite a bit. I cannot wear them often as they hurt my feet.  Plenty of flat Addidas and Pumas have never hurt my feet before but these do. Not a knock on the product as I know everybody feet are significantly different. I wouldn't buy again but that isn't due to poor quality or disliking the appearance of the product - just not for my feet.

These appear to be of high quality.  They are light weight, good looking shoes made from quality materials.  I usually buy 10 1/2's or 11's when I buy at the store where I can try them on before buying.  I ordered 11's but they are small for 11's.  They are right on the edge of being too small.  After wearing them for a couple hours, my toes hurt from making contact with the inside toe of the shoe.  They were also right on the edge as far as the width goes.  I had already worn these for several hours before concluding they were too small, so I won't exchange them.  I bought a shoe stretcher and will try that.  I have another pair of shoes that are too small too so I feel like the shoe stretcher was a good purchase.

Eh.  They go on but this is a narrow shoe and should have been detailed as much.  The thing is, I'm not new to Puma's.  This particular posting is for a narrow fit, not a standard fit.  And I have a narrower foot than standard saying that.  Does it go on?  Yeah, sure.  Does it look pretty okay when on?  Yup.  Is it comfortable?  Nope.  The length is perfect but the shoe squeezes the sides and makes even my ankles swell.  These are tighter than even my Kenneth Cole Unlisted mids.  Those even a year later REQUIRE a shoe horn to get on.  So comfortable once on, no ankle swelling, no foot squeezing, same size, almost nearly identical sole dimensions.  The body of this shoe is just narrow.  I ordered a 10 reg and the shoe itself is really a 10 slim.  If Puma considers what I got a 10 reg, I'd hate to see what they consider a 10 slim in this model.

They are not that comfortable as other brands, the top of the shoes are very thin, they wrap your feet tight, makes you look like you are wearing torpedoes, funny looking when you look down on them, but from the side they look great.

Just wear socks and you should be good.As for other reviews saying they squeak when you walk, Ive noticed if I dont tie them really tight, no squeaking.

The bottoms are very slippery when they are wet. I fell when I stepped on my threshold on my front door when it was raining. Maybe they will become less slippery once I break them in from wear.

I've been wearing white Puma Romas for several years.  I recently ordered a black pair and use those as my work shoes.  They are very comfortable for all day wear.  My feet are a little on the wide so they're snug at first, but not to the point where they are uncomfortable, and eventually they stretch out.My only complaint is that they take on a permanent odor after about 4-6 months.  Maybe the issue is with my feet and not the shoes, maybe I wear the shoes tighter than they are meant to be worn.  My workaround is I got some Odor eaters replacement inserts, makes them feel like brand new.  Highly recommend these shoes.

Narrower than I was expecting so if you have a wide arch you may want to size up.  That being said, they have stretched out pretty well after wearing for several days.  Overall, a quality shoe.

Leather Puma sneakers are always narrow,but....very soft,comfortable, leather,that stretches and conforms to the shape of your foot like a good pair of driving gloves fit your hands. Once the leather breaks in,these are super comfortable.  I have a medium wide foot with a very high arch,and this is my brand for sneakers. Laces could be a little longer,so minus a star,but easy enough to get new ones.

Okay...first of all these are the best shoes i have ever purchased. One thing to remember is to order a half size up, i did and they fit perfectly.They are a little narrow however...so people with wider feet probibly wont think they are as comfort able...but for me they are fine.

I have one foot bigger than the other so most times I don't buy shoes on line. I really like the look and they do feel pretty good/comfortable. My right foot (bigger foot) is a little snug but that's expected. I'm pretty sure from past experience it will stretch enough. Otherwise, so far, a very good sneaker for everyday use.

This show is made narrow. I already knew this prior to ordering it and made accommodations so that it'd fit me well. I went up a size and find them to be a great fit. Perhaps, guys with smaller feet will be able to order exact sizes and still have a comfortable shoe in this one. For me, going up one was wise and made quite the positive difference. I love the look and feel of this shoe and I Highly recommend it to others.

The look of these shoes is what made me purchase them. They LOOK great. The problem is that they are not comfortable. They are narrow and don’t have much support or padding in the soles of the shoes. I can’t wear them more than a couple hours without my feet hurting.
"
6280,"
Just got these and I really like the look and fit.  Classic Puma styling and very clean lines.  For me, fit is good because my feet are average-to-thin width and a medium arch.  For those that have a high arch, I would recommend that you either get inserts or look elsewhere, as there is no arch support.The reason why I'm giving only 2 stars is because the shoes appear to have ZERO GENUINE LEATHER content.  Pretty sure when I was a kid, friends had similar Pumas and those were 100% leather.  I realize that PU and ""synthetic leather"" is often better than it was 20-30 years ago, but doesn't make it okay to list them ""leather"" when they are not.Will still probably keep these, but I'm very concerned about long-term breathability and durability.  If they don't last long...or if they do, I may update the rating accordingly.  Regardless, there is a principle here.  These are NOT real leather.

This Puma show made me fall in love with the Roma line up and has been the reason why I only go for gum sole shoes. Loved it when I was in high school because it went with every outfit I wore. Back then I wish I bought multiple pairs. I'm glad I was able to find them once again, as I struggled for the past 8 years to find them. If you are considering this shoe, go half a size to maybe one full size up. I wear a 9.5 men's, and when they arrived the fit too tight on the toe box area. A 10 may have fit better. It's a great shoe, just bear that in mind.

I like these shoes for the look, comfort is okay. They are a stiff shoe so be warned to break them before you wear them for long periods of time. I did developed blisters on both my pinky toes.

To me these ran true to size my foot size is an 11.5 C. I ordered a 12 and these fit perfectly. Feel slightly snug in width, but that is the was I like my shoe to fit. I ordered these shoes as my workout shoes in the gym and so far they have done what they are supposed to do.

The retro look is great! No complaints about that. However, I comfortably wear a size 11 in most major sneaker brands, but thanks to trusting in prior Amazon customer reviews, I ordered an 11 1/2 in the Puma Roma Classic. This worked out perfectly! They're a little snug due to the sleek, tennis-style design, but not uncomfortable if worn with a lighter-weight sock. If your size is available in a wide width, that should do the trick...otherwise, get a 1/2 size larger and it should be fine.

The shoes themselves are very nice and I love the style.  However,  the figment for me is a big problem.  I am usually a 11-11.5 US Men's for the majority of my footwear (sneakers,  boots,  sandals).  These however,  at just an 11 were too big.  I have a wider foot than longer,  and these would fit someone well with my opposite foot type; long and skinny, not wide and somewhat shirt. I exchanged the 11s for 10.5 and they still are loose on me.
"

I have several pairs of Romas. I started wearing this Puma model over Adidas for athletic competition years ago because it just fit better.

I first bought these Pumas because they're made with synthetics, not leather. The length (size 9) was just right for me, but they pinched on the outer side just behind the toes. I thought this would lessen after breaking them in, but the pinching remains to some degree. My feet get little red spots at the point of pinching. In spite of this, I purchased another pair recently, since the sneakers have worn so well -- much better than my previous brand.
"

The toe box is too tight. This is the 1st time I have ever had this problem. I'm not sure if Puma is manufacturing their shoes different in 2021, but it's highly disappointing since I have been buying size 15 for over 4 years straight and this is the 1st time I have felt discomfort in them.

I'm being generous with the star rating. I want to like these shoes, but Puma is disappointing me. They look nice, particularly in the photos, but their sizing is off for sure. I've been wearing 10s for a long time, and I have a wide variety of shoes and boots from all different brands. Pumas do not seem to match everyone else's sizing standards; they are way too tight. I tried multiple Puma 10s and they're all tight. I bought 11s this time and they are still not wide enough. If I decide to try 12s and they fit, that's great, but it would be nicer if Puma just got on board with everyone else. I don't know if they imagine a world where everyone has a narrow foot, or they just want to have narrow-footed customers, but neither one makes sense.

These shoes are super comfortable, though a little small, and look great on me. I ordered my usual size and I have to wear super thin socks to even get them on, but I don’t mind because when I run I like how snug they are to my feet which prevents friction and blisters. If I were getting these for all day wear and not just for my daily workouts I would have definitely exchanged them for the next size up.

Compared to the standard Puma Roma's, avoid the ""basic"" line at all costs. Man made leather is terrible and creases as soon as you try them on. They also squeak like crazy. As others have stated, this is an extremely narrow shoe and will fit very tightly unless you have narrow feet. I disagree with others that the shoe is a half or whole size too small, I ordered a half size up and had more room than I would like at the toe box, but I guess every foot is different. I got these on sale for $26, and for that price I guess they are going to be beaters, but the MSRP is $59 and they are absolutely not worth that. Overall, disappointed in the Roma Basics line.

Sneakers looks nice but that's where it ends. The sneaker is very narrow on the sides but also on the top of the laces. The bottom rubber also feels like I'm walking on a narrow board. Kinda feels like I'm on a balance beam. There is little to no padding in the sneaker. The sole of the sneaker is very thin. Side walls are also very thin. Put them on to test fit and walked around the house and the material already creased in less than 20 steps. There is barely any flex in the toes so feels like I'm walking on my tippy toes. If you want to try them get them a size larger than you normally wear.

My main ""sneakers"" are Etnies skateboard shoes. I find they look great and most importably are incredibly comfortable and very easy to just slip on and off. I would reflexly just toss on my skate shoes to go out and do yard work or play soccer on the lawn. But they are $60+ shoes and I'd rather not mess them up.So I figured I'd buy a pair of true sneakers to use instead. Found these Pumas on sale for $30. Nice price, they don't look all that great, but just for work/play sneakers these should be great.And they would be great for this purpose at that price if they weren't the most UNCOMFORTABLE SNEAKERS I HAVE EVER WORN. No matter how carefully you put them on, the shoe tongue always manages to fold over onto itself and create an irritating and eventually painful lump between the top of your foot and the shoe. Not much more to say.. My feet start hurting in these after 10 minutes.Absolute garbage sneakers.

These are fantastic shoes for walking and with the specially designed tread will make a great shoe for this winter when the snow and ice begins covering the ground and making slipping a possibility.

First let me tell you that I grew up playing competitive soccer. Puma and Adidas were the only brands I would ever wear. Puma however has always been my choice. The durability matching the comfort and style leaves no argument. Having said this, I'm obviously quite familiar with Puma. Now days I'm a bartender. I work on my feet. I ordered the Romas for work. Before then every day I got off work my feet hurt. As soon as I started wearing these shoes at work my foot aches stopped. They are light, comfortable and don't slip. I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone that works on their feet. Bartenders and servers especially! Solid black,industry standard. They don't slip and they wipe off clean with a warm wash cloth.

It's a good looking shoe but the size and the width are smaller than one would expect. I buy a lot of Puma shoes. They normally run true to size. This particular style runs narrow and at least a half size short in the length. It is truly disappointing. Unfortunately I trusted them to be correct and disposed of the box and materials immediately. Now I cant return them. I would recommend you heck closely order a half size larger, and if you have more than a medium width forget them all together.

I wanted to like these and got them for the classic look but they are not that comfortable. The leather is very thin and light combined with what I feel is a very thin and cheap sole with little to none arch support makes you feel you bought an knockoff shoe. Because of the thin soft leather and the extra narrow sole they tend to get wrinkles around the ball of your toes and curve of your arches. Definitely not a everyday shoe.

As with other reviewers, I found the shoes to be extremely narrow, especially in the toe box. These are probably the most narrow shoes I have ever owned, and I have narrow feet.

As a school teacher, I've looked for a nice looking comfortable all-black shoe. This is more comfortable than a typical dressy shoe, but more lightweight than I expected. If you're looking for a durable athletic shoe, this is not it. Although I liked the price, I do not plan to buy this shoe again.

I'm a 10W, or 10.5, (wide feet.) I ordered 11's since I read that you should size-up. I did. I received them and they still felt a little too tight even though I bought 1 size bigger than I usually do. My boyfriend tried them on (he's a real size 11) and they did NOT fit him comfortably... he would have to buy a 12 if he wanted these to fit him. I'll wear them even though they're slightly snug on me, but I would not buy them again. If you want these, order 1.5 bigger than you usually and they'll still feel a little snug.
"
6432,"
These are weird shoes, they don't seem shaped for human feet. I wear a 10 and ordered up a half size (10.5 D) --- the shoes are plenty long, but incredibly narrow. The ""fabric"" of the shoe is a fake leather that is more akin to plastic. The insole is virtually non-existent, the shoes are basically flat inside and provide no support, and the soles are cheapo, thin, and glued on rather than stitched. Terrible ventilation makes it feel like you're walking in a puddle when your feet start to sweat ... they don't breathe at all. I gave these 2 stars rather than 1 due to the low price, but honestly they're garbage for my needs so it's just $30 that I'll be throwing in the trash. NOT RECOMMENDED unless you have clown feet that never sweat.
"

I was specifically interested in the Romas because they had a ""leather upper for long wear and serious style"".  I ordered the shoes, on sale, from a participating Amazon vendor. My order was shipped and delivered as expected, but when I unwrapped the shoes, they had no leather... anywhere...  and the manufacturer's stickers stated ""other materials"".  I called Puma directly and was told that their shoes (as stated on their site) were made of leather and I should try to return them to Amazon for a leather pair.  I did so, thinking maybe a pair directly sourced from Amazon would be leather, as advertised.  I paid full price for the second pair of Romas (Black/NightShade/Orange... not my first color choice, but sourced and shipped directly from Amazon) and they were not leather either.  Very frustrated I called Puma again, and this time was told that the shoes on their site were only leather if they said ""Genuine Leather""!  Are you kidding me...?!?!  Talk about advertising that does not accurately represent the product.  Its great if you want to make animal friendly products, but call it what it is... synthetic!  DO NOT ORDER THESE IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT A LEATHER SHOE, YOU WILL RECEIVE ""OTHER MATERIAL"" SNEAKERS.

I love Puma and always get a 10.  My shoe size is typically a 9.5 in most other athletic shoes and a 10 in Nike.  These have a little room at the end of them, but they don't feel roomy since they do run a bit narrow.  It's like when I buy 33 pants to get a little extra in the legs when buying jeans sometimes.  I got the all whites and will try to wear them only in the warmer weather.  I've had many pairs of Romas and Whirlwinds and they're comfortable for the day.  All white's not really my thing, but for $32 you can't go wrong.  They go with everything.

Great looking classic. That's why I bought it but it's a terrible shoe. Flat. Hard. No support at all. Not something to wear if you have to be on your feet.

Buy with discretion.

Okay for the money but I have now decided Pumas were not made for my feet.  They simply run too small and narrow for me.  I do like their styles though.  These are pleather in case you are wondering.  They are the man-made version of leather.  That, by itself, is not bad.  Puma just cannot make a shoe wide enough for me.  I like the way their driving mocs look and feel too but they are just too narrow.  By the time I find a shoe wide enough to wear comfortably, the shoe needs to be 8 feet long.  I don't know who can wear these things...

I have these in Black as well and will base my experience review on those. I am a size 12 and flat footed, the sneakers fit great with thinner and sports socks.

Sneaker shows very little sign of wear with heel looking like new and very little loss in cushioning.The only ""complain"" would be in driving.  Longer drives of 1 hour+ led to discomfort in my heels.

Cool looking/feeling shoes. Trustable brand name. Not that expensive either. Just got them but it didn't take long to break them in.

These looked awesome in the pics on the web & looked very similar to the severely beat-up Pumas I inherited from my younger brother a few years ago. I guess I was just being overly optimistic, despite having read several ""narrow"" warning reviews. I received them and knew immediately they were no good.I waited for my wife to come home and showed them to her, she agreed that they were waaay too narrow, especially for my feet. I have wider than normal feet. These were not so comfortable. Plus, my wide feet were immediately starting to warp the inner walls of the shoe & made it look like it was collapsing outwardly. I thought to myself is this normal? Will this go away/ normalize over time? I ran to the garage & grabbed a somewhat newer, other pair of Pumas I own. They are much wider than these & fit me much more comfortably and normally. I ended up returning these for a refund the next day.Now, I did take very accurate measurements of these & compared the numbers to that other similar beat-up pair. They were all VERY similar, but comparing these to that other wider pair of Pumas I own, there were some differences. Plus, those are a hundred times more comfortable. I gave up on finding a new pair of Pumas & wore flip-flops everywhere for 6 months after this, Lol :D

Quality is subpar. Definitely not what they once were. The last pair I purchased back in the early 2000’s were strong and better quality. After 2 days the sneakers are already creasing in different areas. Feel very cheap on your feet.For the price..I would only recommend this to someone who is using these on occasion. A summer sneaker to match an outfit, 2-3 times a week. Wouldn’t recommend them other than that.

MOST OF THE SHOE FITS, BUT THE TOE BOX IS VERY VERY NARROW. I'VE LOOSENED THE LACES ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM, BUT STILL, THE BONES IN THE FRONT FOOT ARE PAINFULLY TIGHT AND THE SHOE IS JUST TOO NARROW TO ACCOMMODATE, BUT THE NEXT SIZE UP WOULD BE LOOSE EVERYWHERE ELSE

Great pair of shoes that I've been wearing regularly for about 10 months (and counting). The only issue I have is that the white material tends to scratch easily.

I have a pair of white Puma Roma shoes that fit quite well; so I bought these black Puma Roma shoes in the very same size.  The blacks just seem to fit a little too snug over the wide part (the ball) of my feet.  I hope that they'll loosen up with wear, but right now the fit is a little annoying.

It's been a while since I've purchased leather shoes. I typically go with New Balance or Asics. These shoes fit a little narrower than both brands. By the Puma chart I should be wearing an 8. I purchased 9's and the length was about right. I don't have them broken in completely, but overall I would say I was happy. I believe they are going to get dirty easily, but what do you expect from a solid white shoe.

These shoes squeak when you are walking and I don't think they are made out of leather. They are not comfortable and it's feels like I'm wearing plastic shoes. I'm going to give them away or donate them and I will not wear them again. I have bought like ten different pairs of these and I don't immediately wear them so I hope that the rest of them are not like this. I'm going to start reading the reviews before I buy from now on.☹️

I've always liked the Puma design and wore Pumas years ago.  I got a pair of Puma running shoes last Christmas and was very happy with them.  I like white with the black design so I decided to try these since there was a good price on them.  I like the way they look with jeans and sweats and they are very comfortable.  Good price and good looks, what's not to like?

Followed people's reviews on sizing. I'm a sneaker buff. I wear an 11.5 rest of my pumas fit great. But ordered 1/2 size up like people said. Nope, too big. But great sneaker. Amazon sent me a new 11.5 pair before I even had to send the wrong size back. They give you about a month to do so. I've sent them back and didn't feel rushed to do so. Love these shoes.

I hate these shoes. Bought them as walking shoes for vacation and as soon as i put them on they felt uncomfortably tight. I do not have wide feet at all so i figured i just needed to break them in. After 2 days of walking around my feet are covered in blisters. The foam sole feels like walking on a piece of wood. I had to buy another pair of shoes while on vacation because these are such tight garbage shoes.

I've had worn Roma's for many years, I can say close to 10 years straight...Has the material or anything else changed? This is the 2nd pair I purchased thru Amazon and these ones I cannot wear at all. The Toe Box is extremely tight fitting, no comfort/cushion at all. The exterior shell material leaves hard creases which is not at all what they used to be. Will never order these online again.
"
6600,"
Not very comfortable, but everyone compliments me on the style.  I would only buy these again because I really like the way they look on my feet & they fit my style.  They're good for when I go somewhere casual, I just tie them to fit comfortably, then knot the laces on the inside so I can take them on and off without tying them.

Having ordered many pairs of Pumas, I am aware that they tend to run a little smaller based on the width. If ordering a pair, I recommend getting a half size bigger. Especially if your feet tend to swell or you have a slightly wider foot. As for the look, comfort and durability, I think this company is as good as if not better than Nike, Adidas, UA, etc. By far the best looking shoe made!

I ordered my usual size but this pair gives my foot a strange feel. The heel and foot section fits well but is a bit tight across the toes. This is unlike my other Pumas that I wear regularly of the same size. Also, there is no extra room in the length like my other sneakers or athletic shoes that I own of same size. I could easily have ordered a half-size larger. Other than the tighter fit, I have no other complaint.

Disappointed that it's so hard to find leather shoes anymore on here. Shoes fit, they don't last long since they're not leather.

I just got these and they're so narrow. I just took them off because they were so tight. The blood circulation was getting cut off. I wear an 11.5 and the length was right on, but not the width.

I have a wide foot so I ordered one size larger than I normally wear.I chose Puma because I had worn them back in the 70's (seriously, the blue suede ones)They have become cheaper in feel on my feet, not the solid comfort and support I thought I remembered.Still look good, price was reasonable with free shipping.Will have to see how long they last.

This is probably my favorite pair of shoes that I have. These shoes fit me as i expected it to. The brand itself tells you that it will last long. I wear these a lot and it is still in a good condition as when I got them from the seller. Thank you for this great product. I highly recommend buying from this seller! You wont have any regrets!

I love these shoes but I don't know what happen these shoes were like a mini boat waiting to sail.

I like the look of the shoes and they look great.  If you're someone with wide feet I wouldn't recommend these shoes for you. I find that puma shoes tend to have that slimmer fit through my personal experience. These fit a little tighter than my other tennis shoes. Overall I'm satisfied.

For 30 bucks on prime days was worth a shot. They look cool but they are way to narrow to actually wear all day.  I even ordered 1/2 size larger assuming would help. I'm gonna wear them around house and hopefully break them in but looks like I am back to wearing Reebok Classics.

Lately, I'm favoring PUMA over many other brands of sneakers.The size fit as expected. The shoe feels somewhat flimsily put together, but they are very lightweight and comfortable. Moreover, the shoe looks good with most types of casual pants including skinny jeans, straight legs, Levis 501 and 550, or cargo pants. I only wish they came with thicker laces, but a trip to Modell's easily remedies that gripe. Oh, I bought the white/black style, so cleaning was required almost after the first wear. For this reason, I limit how often I wear them, and consider WHERE I'm going to be wearing them.

These Puma shoes are comfortable and stylish. I have bought the same pair year after year because of the reliability in quality and size. I love them and will continue to purchase them as long as they are in fashion. I purchase a new pair every year or year in half so my shoes look fresh and white, not because they are falling apart.

I try to briskly walk (not run) at least five miles a day, on average, for exercise, almost entirely on pavement (sidewalks).  After using them for about three weeks, I can report that the Puma Romas seem perfect for this, well-fitting, light-weight, and giving me no problems at all, not even during the initial breaking-them-in phase.  As things stand right now, this'll be my brand and model for the rest of my walking life.

Fashion-wise, they're great looking shoes.  Judging by how they look and feel, I wouldn't call them ""every day"" shoes.  As several of the other reviews say, they look and feel pretty cheap, and they're not very comfortable.  I wear a 10 in just about every brand, and have a pretty narrow foot, but they still feel pretty tight after a couple days of use.That being said, they look great.

This is a very good looking pair of shoes but they are not leather but a pleather.  They run short and very narrow but the heel is quite wide. I always buy a men's size 10 but these were just too small and too tight.  I ordered a half a size larger and they were still too narrow and the heel way too wide.  In summary, these shoes were manufactured where .  American sizing apparently is not a priority or even understood.  NOT RECOMMENDED

I have a number of Puma shoes and they have been satisfactory in the past. The length  of these was fine but the width is narrow.Unfortunately, despite the description, they are definitely not leather. In years past, people answered the question about the upper material by saying at that time it was leather. There is no material tag on the tongue but a paper label inside says “other material “ textile lining.It doesn’t look/feel like leather and the narrow fit won’t stretch. Disappointed by the deceptive text. These are going to be returned.

I wear a size 13 but in a pinch I could go with a 12.  This sneaker, that is marked 13, seems smaller than any sneaker that I have ever owned.  there is no toe room and the sneaker itself is very narrow.  the quality of the sneaker very good.  The picture of the sneaker indicates a white puma logo on the tongue but the sneaker I received did not have this logo,  All in all the sneaker is OK but not great.

The shoe looks great, but I wouldn't recommend these for daily use or for a long day of walking. The insoles aren't made to support anyone unless they're wearing them for long enough to have a photo shoot or for driving a mile up the road to get fast food drive thru.

Disappointed that the shoes shipped are actually NOT leather.  I don't know if Puma has changed this recently; or if there is a real leather version still alongside a ""cheaper"" version.  Rightly or wrongly, my head went straight to ""are these genuine Puma or nasty fakes?"".The fake leather feels right and I wouldn't have known were it not for the labeling.  Guess we'll see how they last.  My last real leather pair of these lasted several years with frequent wear.

I purchase these old school Pumas for myself in men’s’ size 6 as they didn’t have a ladies 7.5 available. They are narrow and snug so I’ve had to slowly break them in.

I purchased these (size 12) because I ordinarily wear 11 1/2 Narrow (B) and several reviewers said they were a bit small and too narrow.  Also, I refuse to pay $100 ++ for shoes to be used primarily for outside chores. The padding and arch support are adequate; upper materials are somewhat stiff so break-in period has been a little longer than expected. I've worn these shoes a few days per week for about three months now. They are showing no sign of premature wear. and I'm increasingly happy with them as time goes on.  Overall, these are an option worth considering for those who (1) find many Medium (D) width shoes too wide, (2) appreciate good value, and (3) care not a whit about celebrity endorsements.

They run small -- go a half size up. I am typically a US women's 8 / men's 6.5 / Euro 39. I find that if I order shoes using Euro sizing which is determined by actual length (you can find charts that convert Euro size to centimeters) the fit is more accurate than going with US sizing. The Puma size chart shows Euro 39 corresponds with US men's 7 which is what I ordered and these fit me perfectly.I got the gum sole in white/gold and love the styling. These are more contemporary and sporty looking than most women's white sneakers which can sometimes look like bulky nursing shoes. The quality of leather is good and the construction is good. My only complaint is that after one wearing, the gold foil logo imprint on the foot bed inside one of the shoes started to peel, which is to be expected and not really an issue as this remains out of sight when wearing, however, a printed foot bed would have been appreciated for better esthetic wear. Also, there is a little glue residue around the toe where the gum sole meets the leather. The stitching is excellent.The first time I broke these in I wore them for a whole day while working on my feet and didn't experience any fatigue or aches. Comfort wise, they're not bad, no issues with rubbing and not stiff, however not as comfy and low profile as my favorite Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 (yep, the yellow Uma Thurman Kill Bill ones!), but these are half the price. I would say the Romas are moderate to very good and will get even more comfortable as the leather softens with wear. The arch support is good too.  The grip on the sole is great and the shoe has an average degree of flexibility.I love them and am glad to have the Roma Classic Gum in my rotation for a moderately low profile leather sneaker. Versatile and sporty and good for wearing with jeans, shorts, leggings, or casual dresses. I do wish that Puma would bring back the Aiki Cat slip ons (no laces), but these are a decent alternative within the brand.

I use these treadmill and lifting weights.  I use my Asics for squats and these for upper body workouts.  Theses are like my Nike Cortez's except they have a leather tongue instead of Nike's stupid nylon one.  The leather tongue is very luxurious and puts Nike to shame which makes me sad because I like Nike.  I wear these with Puma shirts as to match and so far okay but they need dark navy Puma logos instead of off blues and sissy girl colors like candy or windows 8 start menu.I used to like Puma Suede's but last pair hurt my feet after walking on sidewalks for long amounts of time.  I am not sure why that happened.  Seemed weird like they used to be more comfortable.  Maybe I got a bad pair.Had/have a pair of Puma Dallas I never wear because they are too loose in the width and about 1/2 or more too long.  They slip off the heel when running no matter how tight I lace them (which makes them look long and too skinny and just funny) and they wiggle when I squat which is dangerous and annoying.  The low heel is nice but who cares if it wiggles, how can I lift confidently with wiggle?Puma whirlwind had stupid nubby outsole which looked like dumb golf cleats and worse hurt my feet when I was walking to the mall and in the mall.  On hard surfaces the nubs make a funny noise and people stared at me obviously amused by my choice of footwear.  They click clacked on the hard tile so not good choice for out and about activities.  Maybe sprinting on clay track or grass turf.  Stay off concrete/asphalt/indoor surfaces.The G. Villas seem nice tennis shoe comparable to my Kswiss Classics so I might try them but I do not need tennis shoes right now.  If I did I would rather G Unit Reebox's.The speed cats piqued my interest some time ago but I was not sure if the sleek styling was suitable for casual wear, too European.  I could definitely see the value as sports trainers am I really liked when the outsole was good year rubber tire inspired.  Kind of like racing car slicker tires i.e. less tread more traction.  Now I am into working out more so these would be more appropriate for me as long as I did not combine the with no show socks as is a current trend.  I need coverage on my Achilles plus like wearing Nike quarter crews so you can SEE the logo.  No show's have logo on bottom of sock wear you can not see it, how stupid is that.All in all these are probably the best puma I have had not to low like the speed cats which would have to be purely sports trainers.  I can wear these with jeans and look cool like they are Adidas superstars or something.  Low shoes look bad with jeans unless you are bisexual and wear tight jeans or something.  I wear looser jeans so low shoes tend to be paired training shorts.  I can bench press with loose jeans and look normal.So these worked for the money , look good for casual, knocked off the Asics Corsair's/Nike Cortez but as least incorporated a leather tongue which should be almost mandatory, and are okay for sports and training.  Not hardcore running or atg squats but bench pressing, leg pressing, light track work etc.Update 8/9/2019:I just received a white with black stripe. They are not as good as the originals. They are lighter and cheap naugahyde. They had a scratch on one and the other was crushed. They are comfortable but not the quality I expect from a german brand. Very cheap chinese feel.

Unfortunately the right shoe has two glaring marks on it. On the back heel and on the left side. As a person that is use to buying in store, trying my item on before purchasing, this was very disappointing. A brand new pair of shoes should always look like a new pair of shoes. I debated returning them but not sure how well that would work. Now I'm feeling a bit gun shy on making a second Amazon purchase.

I like tight black leather shoes for city cycling. Can look and feel like a bike shoe with clips, but I can walk around with a normal looking shoe. Also important is a stiff sole that my pedals can grip. Since going vegan, it’s been tough to find and these are great. I’d love it if a gum sole with black “leather” was an option. Note: depending on the shoe, I wear 9.5 or 10, but these are definitely tight and narrow, and I had to return the original 9.5 for a 10, which is still snug, but the fit I like for cycling.

I bought these PUMAs based on their appearance and price point. I like the gum sole and wanted a white athletic shoe that had a subtle logo. I was not disappointed with any aspect of the shoes appearance. The fit however, for my feet, is not comfortable. I have a flat foot but can generally wear other popular name brand shoes in my size without difficulty. The second photo comparison is the black rubber sole of my New Balance 574s, which fit my feet great! The PUMA Roma’s fit very much like most of my Adidas tennis shoes (ie. very narrow insole and small toe box). I did not realize these Roma’s had that type of fit or I may have ordered up one size. I will still wear the new PUMAs because I like the way the look and wear them more for fashion than exercise. I’m hoping that with some wear, they stretch a little and better conform to my feet.

I work at an auto parts store, we are required to wear black polishable shoes. every other shoe no matter the price has fallen apart quickly. Dress shoes are not made to be durable or comfortable, especially when you are on your feet, in all sorts of weather conditions , ice,snow.... so when I found these, I was willing to try them because from previous experience puma shoes have been super durable. I have worn the shoes for 2 and a half months at work, and they still look new (even after I spilled brake fluid all over them), and feel just as good as day one. on any other shoes, by the first week they would be all scuffed up ( not these).I look forward to getting a lot more use out of them. And I am curious to see how much better they work in ice, snow, slush compared to dress shoes ive had since they have a really good grip. I will most likely be buying these again when someday they do wear out. Update, 9 months later and these shoes are still going strong, the soles are getting a little wore out and my feet hurt if I do alot of walking, but for the most part still do the job.The rubber on the sides are detaching a little and the bottoms are loosing tread. They do not take water and snow well at all it soaks it right up. (nothing some water proof spray cant fix)Update 2 Well they made it 10 months, and I honestly think if I had not of accidentally put a hole in the side of them from a sharp object that almost cut my foot open at work ( not anything the materials could have prevented, phenomenal synthetic upper) I could have easily gotten another month or 2 out of them buy just putting $1 soles in them. I am still really impressed since most the shoes I wear after work fall apart much quicker and I don't even wear them as much. I estimate that I got about 1800 hours out of these shoes! Now onto pair number two.

These fit beautifully, are a great casual shoe, and the price is incredible when you start comparison shopping for a decent shoe.The uppers are soft, the shoe is light, and the fit is comfortable. The first time I put them on, out of the box, was to try out how they felt around the house, and it was hard to tell I had shoes on my feet. That’s not an exaggeration and, yes, they were laced up.Arch support is good for me, but that's an individual thing.They are surprisingly quiet on hard floors compared to some of my other Pumas.I've only been wearing these for a couple of weeks, but I don't need more than that to tell if I like a shoe.In agreement with other reviewers you should go a half size larger when buying a Puma. I take a 10 ½ D (M) dress shoe, but my other Pumas are 11’s and they fit well.I’ve always gone with a Wilson tennis for work because sometimes I’m on hard floors for a number of hours and they’ve always given me good support and comfort. So I started out looking to replace my old Wilson Court Avengers, and after weeding out the hideous, those with few or no reviews, all the mesh uppers, and checking on brands I’ve worn before like Adidas, Etonic, and New Balance, I found myself looking at somewhere north of $70-$80 for a pair of kick around work shoes. I found nothing I liked that was reasonably priced (you notice how the price changes depending on your size) so I decided to check on Puma to see what they had and that worked out fine.The only nit I have is the tongue loop, the small twin cuts midway to 2/3 up the tongue that the laces run through to prevent the tongue from sliding into the shoe when you slip your foot in, is the Puma logo at the top of the tongue. I prefer the mid-tongue loop, but that’s an extremely small con to me compared to fit and look.

So I bought these for myself using the ""try it before you buy it"" option. I'll start by saying that I normally wear women's size 10 and got the men's 8 which is my usual fit.Esthetically these shoes are super nice looking. I bought them because I have now learned how to properly care for a pair of white shoes (go me!) and they reminded me of the ones Freddy Mercury wore.Off the bat the material of these felt suuuuper cheap, like they're knock offs or something. I have a pair of white leather Pumas and you can just tell those are quality shoes.My feet are fairly thin and I have never had a problem with ""regular"" (non-wide) shoes being too small or needing wide shoes. These ones, however, were incredibly tight on my feet despite fitting size/length wise. I honestly don't think sizing up would've helped but the cheapness of the shoe made me not want to find out.I did not buy it after I tried it. But thanks for the option Amazon!

I love Puma sneakers and I have purchased about 10 or so of them so far. I love these as they are very light and seem well built, however they are far too narrow and after wearing them all day my feet start to hurt. I usually wear a size 11 and I purchased an 11. I should have gone a 1/2 size or even a full size up. I never had such an issue with other Puma sneakers and I'm not sure why these seem to have such an issue. I wear them to work here and there but I would not wear them on a trip or somewhere where I would be walking all day as my feet would be killing me.Overall recommended as they are good build and very light. However make sure you get a size up, I wish I would have, but I'm making them work.***update***I liked these so much I purchased another pair in black. I went for a 1/2 size larger than usual and they fit better, however still seem a lit too narrow. But they look great and I get complements on them. I really like the fact that they are light and seem pretty tough. I do notice that whatever the black pair are made of (pleather), they seem to be very noisy and squeak as I bend and flex them.Over-all, a great pair of shoes as long as you get at least a 1/2 size larger and give them time to be worked in.

Item stated as leather - item is all synthetic.  Super tight width.  Concerned if I kept to try to break in the synthetic material would crack over time.

I thought these would stretch out a little after I got them. I should have sent them back. The styling is that classic puma look but these just don't fit right.

Great style and awesome shoes, first time I’ve ever owned a pair of pumas, I usually wear Nike’s or boots, I’m about 11.5 in shoes with a slightly wide foot and high arch, so the support is pretty good feel like I could run a few miles in them as I just finished a 5 mile walk. The reason I took this walk was to see if I could maybe help loosen the toe a bit. Didn’t work, my pinky started going numb on me, had to stop a couple times take the shoe off for the circulation. As one person said I don’t write this to discourage cause for the price it’s a quality product just get a half size up, if you got a wide foot maybe go a full size up. Too late to return them for myself but I guess I’ll just use them for those occasions where I know I won’t be walking much

I'm reliably a size 9 in pretty much every shoe. Some may be a bit loose or snug but I've never run into something as off as these things. I have shoes that are 8.5 which are snug but still comfortable. These things are on a whole other level. They seem about a full size smaller than indicated. The toe box is super pinched, tapers sharply which cramps your outside toes, and they seem too short as well. Looking at the size chart on the tongue it looks like they consider this a UK 8, US 9, and EU 42... which doesn't line up with any size chart I've seen elsewhere. Most have an EU 42 the equivalent of a US 8.5, which explains a lot. Even a half size up these would be a bit narrow but in a supportive rather than crushing way.If you have super narrow and not very tall feet, this is your shoe. There's nothing wrong with the construction and they look great. Unfortunately my feet can't conform to this shape.

Classic, clean, smooth, simplistic and beautiful. A stark contrast to the ""LSD trip"" styles of sneakers these days. I love the looks of the Roma's.That said, they are very stiff, and the leather creaks and feels cheap. I feel like they'll crack before long. I'm going to try some sort of shoe butter to soften it up. They fit VERY tight. I have skinny, long feet and with my normal arch support inserts i wear comfortably with ALL of my other shoes (about 14 pair)...but not these. There is very little top to bottom room, and the width is snug. I generally wear a 10½ - 11. I bought the 11 for these after reading the reviews. The length is just on the small side, but i think an 11½ would be too large. This makes for a shoe that feels like a part of my foot...which is good...but they also start to ache after a couple of hours. I hope they'll loosen up when they're broken in. Which will probably be never as i don't ever want to get them dirty.But...that's the price for fresh kicks i suppose.

Go a half size up. I ordered my size and the big toes hit the front when I stood up. Also, I must have a really narrow foot cause it was still a little wide. Just slightly. I didnt want to pull on the laces like if it was a horse in order to get the right width. Quite honestly, the only pair of shoes I had luck with were La Sportiva. Problem is, they are really freaking expensive but man, totally worth it. Not advertising for them, I have a pair. Also, I'm one of those ppl that wish ppl that comment on items give another recommendation for another product if they hate the one they are talking about. La Sportiva is the way to go.

Size 9 US  8 UK or 42 in Eur .. long and narrow. I can only wear them for a couple hours before the sides of my arches start aching. I do not remember Romas ever fitting like this.

Long and  NARROW.. to narrow like I said I am a fan of retros you cant go wrong with a classic.. but these Romas fit like Chucks and there is a reason Chucks  are not on my go to list.  These Romas are damn near un wearable.  I wore them for about 4 hours around the house before I had to pull em off.  just that uncomfortable. and Wide wasn't an option so there goes $50 out the windowI would return them if I thought I could.

The Roma fits as it has traditionally in its normal, medium width for me. For those who aren't used to this particular model (synthetic), you will have to break them in for comfort. I do this statically (in one place), as opposed to the usual method of just walking, to better control where the creases occur.  This particular shoe as you may have guessed, is NOT for wide (not even moderately wide) footers or if you have any foot/toe problems though the length is spot on for my size.  I walk a lot, so I usually get the synthetic for durability and ease of maintenance (cleans fairly easily).  I also recommend putting them in a rotation as this model isn't breathable being a synthetic.

I normally wear a size 12. In Puma's, I always wear a size 13.These shoes are a similar design I remember as a kid back in the 70s. They look and feel good. I will be glad when I get some of the extreme brightness knocked off of them - they are an extra, super-duper shade of white!Buying shoes online is hit and miss, mostly miss. I would not have ordered these if I didn't already have a pair of Puma's at home with the prior knowledge that I always need a size larger than normal. You might get by with a half-size larger, but I have to go up 1 full size.I will say that, as with most shoes, these shoes look much better at smaller sizes. The farther you stretch out the design, the more of the appeal they lose; however, as I am getting older, I don't really care about being ""cool"" anymore. Get what you like and rock it with confidence and soak up the nostalgia.

A long time b&w Samba wearer, I switched to this classic Puma on a whim. Great looking shoe. I’m a solid 11 in almost every shoe. The 11 was a half  size too small. Tight in toe and width.

These shows are great to add a titch more style to an outfit than more typical sneakers, but they're still super comfortable.  My feet don't typically require tons of cushion or arch support, so i caution those with bad feet or those who run a lot to maybe avoid these.  I used to be a 50-60miles per week runner, and personally, i had to avoid these type of flattish-arched shoes or my feet would get sore / injured quickly.  However, for the couple miles per day I walk in the city these days (in these shoes) and the 10 miles i run per week (not in these shoes), they work perfectly.  Highly recommend

This shoe is a sharp “looking” shoe, live the color way the overall design is aesthetically on point. BUTTTT, it is the narrowest shoe I have ever owned. I have purchased Puma’s in the past and they were fine, but the Roma is retro design and super narrow especially the Toe Box. I am so disappointed because I was really looking forward to wearing it during the summertime. It’s a very clean profile I just wish it was a little wider. I have been trying to break them in. Hopefully I can loosen them up enough to wear. Length is fine Width Narrow, cushioning is good. If you have a narrow foot the Roma may be the shoe for your.

First off the soles are great. No real break in needed. The weight is deceptive, seems flimsy at first but the construction has held up. More of a kick around walking shoe than anything. Skateboarding and yard work, not such a good idea. Size is a little small by maybe an 1/8"" so no socks or a half size bigger if your toes go all the way to the end of your regular shoe. But all said I love the simple style and they aren't Nike.

Looks great but a little tight if you have wider feet. Tight in the toe box, but fits great everywhere else. Wont be a problem if you have narrow feet. Kind of tight if you have a high arch, so lace a little looser if you have that problem.

Product originally was too small. I wear a size 12 in multiple brands of sneakers but I had to return the 12s for 13s. No big deal and I received my money back when I dropped the item off at UPS-versus having to nag a company for my return money. That was sweet. Once I received the better size I gave them a try. The product is exactly how I expected as far as quality. The sizing though is a wee bit tight in the width department. Now I know I wear a wider shoe but these are still quite narrow. A size 14 would be way too big so I guess I have to stretch them out. This brings me to my next gripe which is in order to stretch them out I would need to wear them quite a bit. I cannot wear them often as they hurt my feet.  Plenty of flat Addidas and Pumas have never hurt my feet before but these do. Not a knock on the product as I know everybody feet are significantly different. I wouldn't buy again but that isn't due to poor quality or disliking the appearance of the product - just not for my feet.

These appear to be of high quality.  They are light weight, good looking shoes made from quality materials.  I usually buy 10 1/2's or 11's when I buy at the store where I can try them on before buying.  I ordered 11's but they are small for 11's.  They are right on the edge of being too small.  After wearing them for a couple hours, my toes hurt from making contact with the inside toe of the shoe.  They were also right on the edge as far as the width goes.  I had already worn these for several hours before concluding they were too small, so I won't exchange them.  I bought a shoe stretcher and will try that.  I have another pair of shoes that are too small too so I feel like the shoe stretcher was a good purchase.

This is the first pair of shoes I’ve ever purchased that were too small and too tight. If I have problems with shoe size it’s always been because they were too large.

The shoes are amazing. Very stylish and go with almost everything you can throw at them. Only downside would be the size. I ordered a 0.5 size larger and wish I had gotten a whole size larger than my usual. They still feel a bit tight and aren't really ideal for driving because of this.

I was so excited to relive my childhood memories with the purchase of the Puma ROMA.  One of the ""classic"" athletic sneakers from back in the day as it were when athletic shoes were becoming the norm and ""specialized.""  I love everything about the Puma ROMA say nothing of wonderful childhood memories.  If only they FIT MY FEET!  But the last on the Puma ROMA's run narrow which is important to know.  So what fits like a glove with Onitsuka Tiger was downright painful with the Puma ROMA & simply not a fit try as I may.  This is why the AMAZON return policy is so important and frankly so good.  The return was easy, no questions asked and straightforward in terms of refund.  (So what did I do in case you are curious???  Purchased another pair of Onitsuka Tiger's (old school, of course!).

Eh.  They go on but this is a narrow shoe and should have been detailed as much.  The thing is, I'm not new to Puma's.  This particular posting is for a narrow fit, not a standard fit.  And I have a narrower foot than standard saying that.  Does it go on?  Yeah, sure.  Does it look pretty okay when on?  Yup.  Is it comfortable?  Nope.  The length is perfect but the shoe squeezes the sides and makes even my ankles swell.  These are tighter than even my Kenneth Cole Unlisted mids.  Those even a year later REQUIRE a shoe horn to get on.  So comfortable once on, no ankle swelling, no foot squeezing, same size, almost nearly identical sole dimensions.  The body of this shoe is just narrow.  I ordered a 10 reg and the shoe itself is really a 10 slim.  If Puma considers what I got a 10 reg, I'd hate to see what they consider a 10 slim in this model.

Let me begin by saying I would buy these shoes again because the price is perfect for what you get. With that said I am a disappointed by the material these shoe are made with. I have wore almost every brand of shoe in my lifetime, these are my first Puma. They are not that comfortable as other brands, the top of the shoes are very thin, they wrap your feet tight, makes you look like you are wearing torpedoes, funny looking when you look down on them, but from the side they look great. I bought these shoe for the price and the look and I am happy with them. Probably wouldn't have bought in a store, but I am not disappointed in my purchase.

I've been wearing puma shoes for a white and usually they run more narrow which I already know. These shoes seemed too narrow and jist didn't seem right.

Ive had these for a couple weeks and boy do they look sharp. The fit is the same as other pairs of Puma's Ive owned (10.5) and no blemishes or coming apart. Ive worn them everyday and my feet dont sweat even though they have a synthetic upper instead of leather. Just wear socks and you should be good.As for other reviews saying they squeak when you walk, Ive noticed if I dont tie them really tight, no squeaking.  The fit is is perfect so they dont slip even if not tied super tight.All in all I love these shoes and Ive always wanted a pair of all whites and Im glad I chose these shoes, especially since I got them on sale for less than $23

I like these shoes okay but they are a little narrow. I don't have wide feet so it is not really that big of deal. I wish I would have gotten a size up but they feel fine.

I've been wearing white Puma Romas for several years.  I recently ordered a black pair and use those as my work shoes.  They are very comfortable for all day wear.  My feet are a little on the wide so they're snug at first, but not to the point where they are uncomfortable, and eventually they stretch out.My only complaint is that they take on a permanent odor after about 4-6 months.  Maybe the issue is with my feet and not the shoes, maybe I wear the shoes tighter than they are meant to be worn.  My workaround is I got some Odor eaters replacement inserts, makes them feel like brand new.  Highly recommend these shoes.

Leather Puma sneakers are always narrow,but....very soft,comfortable, leather,that stretches and conforms to the shape of your foot like a good pair of driving gloves fit your hands.

Laces could be a little longer,so minus a star,but easy enough to get new ones.

Okay...first of all these are the best shoes i have ever purchased. One thing to remember is to order a half size up, i did and they fit perfectly.They are a little narrow however...so people with wider feet probibly wont think they are as comfort able...but for me they are fine.

I have one foot bigger than the other so most times I don't buy shoes on line. I really like the look and they do feel pretty good/comfortable.

This show is made narrow. I already knew this prior to ordering it and made accommodations so that it'd fit me well. I went up a size and find them to be a great fit.

The look of these shoes is what made me purchase them. They LOOK great. The problem is that they are not comfortable. They are narrow and don’t have much support or padding in the soles of the shoes. I can’t wear them more than a couple hours without my feet hurting.
"
7280,"
Just got these and I really like the look and fit.  Classic Puma styling and very clean lines.  For me, fit is good because my feet are average-to-thin width and a medium arch.  For those that have a high arch, I would recommend that you either get inserts or look elsewhere, as there is no arch support.The reason why I'm giving only 2 stars is because the shoes appear to have ZERO GENUINE LEATHER content.  Pretty sure when I was a kid, friends had similar Pumas and those were 100% leather.  I realize that PU and ""synthetic leather"" is often better than it was 20-30 years ago, but doesn't make it okay to list them ""leather"" when they are not.Will still probably keep these, but I'm very concerned about long-term breathability and durability.  If they don't last long...or if they do, I may update the rating accordingly.  Regardless, there is a principle here.  These are NOT real leather.

This Puma show made me fall in love with the Roma line up and has been the reason why I only go for gum sole shoes. Loved it when I was in high school because it went with every outfit I wore. Back then I wish I bought multiple pairs. I'm glad I was able to find them once again, as I struggled for the past 8 years to find them. If you are considering this shoe, go half a size to maybe one full size up. I wear a 9.5 men's, and when they arrived the fit too tight on the toe box area. A 10 may have fit better. It's a great shoe, just bear that in mind.

The retro look is great! No complaints about that. However, I comfortably wear a size 11 in most major sneaker brands, but thanks to trusting in prior Amazon customer reviews, I ordered an 11 1/2 in the Puma Roma Classic. This worked out perfectly! They're a little snug due to the sleek, tennis-style design, but not uncomfortable if worn with a lighter-weight sock. If your size is available in a wide width, that should do the trick...otherwise, get a 1/2 size larger and it should be fine.

The shoes themselves are very nice and I love the style.  However,  the figment for me is a big problem.  I am usually a 11-11.5 US Men's for the majority of my footwear (sneakers,  boots,  sandals).  These however,  at just an 11 were too big.  I have a wider foot than longer,  and these would fit someone well with my opposite foot type; long and skinny, not wide and somewhat shirt. I exchanged the 11s for 10.5 and they still are loose on me.

I have several pairs of Romas. I started wearing this Puma model over Adidas for athletic competition years ago because it just fit better.

I first bought these Pumas because they're made with synthetics, not leather. The length (size 9) was just right for me, but they pinched on the outer side just behind the toes. I thought this would lessen after breaking them in, but the pinching remains to some degree. My feet get little red spots at the point of pinching. In spite of this, I purchased another pair recently, since the sneakers have worn so well -- much better than my previous brand.

The toe box is too tight. This is the 1st time I have ever had this problem. I'm not sure if Puma is manufacturing their shoes different in 2021, but it's highly disappointing since I have been buying size 15 for over 4 years straight and this is the 1st time I have felt discomfort in them.

I'm being generous with the star rating. I want to like these shoes, but Puma is disappointing me. They look nice, particularly in the photos, but their sizing is off for sure. I've been wearing 10s for a long time, and I have a wide variety of shoes and boots from all different brands. Pumas do not seem to match everyone else's sizing standards; they are way too tight. I tried multiple Puma 10s and they're all tight. I bought 11s this time and they are still not wide enough. If I decide to try 12s and they fit, that's great, but it would be nicer if Puma just got on board with everyone else. I don't know if they imagine a world where everyone has a narrow foot, or they just want to have narrow-footed customers, but neither one makes sense.

I typically wear a 10 and my foot is narrower than average, maybe a C.  Length was fine but pretty narrow so these shoes barely fit me. They will stretch out with wear so will be fine, but be warned.  That said they are very nice looking shoes.  It's tough to find a sneaker that isn't clunky and over decorated so these look good.

Well first off they'll do but I've been buying puma for years and these are fake. Is that not illegal. I noticed the puma Roma in black with the tan on the sole has a black puma stripe while the real ones have a white stripe against black and gold pro t on the side and also a green tongue tag on the outside not black even on my black classics. It's not a real puma trust me. These feel so hard and plastic like dollar general shoes.

I don’t have particularly wide feet. I never buy wide shoes. This is my first pair of puma shoes in years. They are very narrow and and uncomfortable out of the box. Not going to bother sending them back for what I paid for them. Maybe they will break in and loosen up after a few miles. Will update review after I wear them a bit.

These shoes are super comfortable, though a little small, and look great on me. I ordered my usual size and I have to wear super thin socks to even get them on, but I don’t mind because when I run I like how snug they are to my feet which prevents friction and blisters. If I were getting these for all day wear and not just for my daily workouts I would have definitely exchanged them for the next size up.

The shoe looks great! It feels a little small (I wear 10.5-11.5, ordered 11, and it felt slightly small)I'm worried that the front of the shoe is starting to wrinkle (when your foot bends near the toes) after only light usage.Biggest complaint: The shoes are not breathable, and I can't wear them for more than a few hours without wanting to take them off to let my feet breathe. take

In 2015 I bought these Roma in the black/white colorway and it fitted so tight in a size 11. 4 years later I decided to buy another pair, this time I go Black/Black colorway because they lasted so long they are very durable and comfortable for every day wear, this time I go 1/2 size up from 11 and it fits perfectly on my slim feet. These are the best shoe from the Puma's collection. They are 100% AUTHENTIC once they are ship and sold by Amazon.com Services.....

I bought the black ones, not for training or sports but for every day at the office. Good made, and looks nice. I feel comfortable and they suite the purpose I bought them for. My size is between 9 and 10, I took 10 and it is just perfect for me. In the begining I thought it will be too narrow - but after few hours they expand to the width of my feet. I think it is a good buying. Concerning quality - I'll wait and see how will they last over time and will report and modify the 5 stars grade accordingly.

Compared to the standard Puma Roma's, avoid the ""basic"" line at all costs. Man made leather is terrible and creases as soon as you try them on. They also squeak like crazy. As others have stated, this is an extremely narrow shoe and will fit very tightly unless you have narrow feet. I disagree with others that the shoe is a half or whole size too small, I ordered a half size up and had more room than I would like at the toe box, but I guess every foot is different. I got these on sale for $26, and for that price I guess they are going to be beaters, but the MSRP is $59 and they are absolutely not worth that. Overall, disappointed in the Roma Basics line.

Sneakers looks nice but that's where it ends. The sneaker is very narrow on the sides but also on the top of the laces. The bottom rubber also feels like I'm walking on a narrow board. Kinda feels like I'm on a balance beam. There is little to no padding in the sneaker. The sole of the sneaker is very thin. Side walls are also very thin. Put them on to test fit and walked around the house and the material already creased in less than 20 steps. There is barely any flex in the toes so feels like I'm walking on my tippy toes. If you want to try them get them a size larger than you normally wear.

My main ""sneakers"" are Etnies skateboard shoes. I find they look great and most importably are incredibly comfortable and very easy to just slip on and off. I would reflexly just toss on my skate shoes to go out and do yard work or play soccer on the lawn. But they are $60+ shoes and I'd rather not mess them up.So I figured I'd buy a pair of true sneakers to use instead. Found these Pumas on sale for $30. Nice price, they don't look all that great, but just for work/play sneakers these should be great.And they would be great for this purpose at that price if they weren't the most UNCOMFORTABLE SNEAKERS I HAVE EVER WORN. No matter how carefully you put them on, the shoe tongue always manages to fold over onto itself and create an irritating and eventually painful lump between the top of your foot and the shoe. Not much more to say.. My feet start hurting in these after 10 minutes.Absolute garbage sneakers.

These are fantastic shoes for walking and with the specially designed tread will make a great shoe for this winter when the snow and ice begins covering the ground and making slipping a possibility.  They are so well designed and tailored to fit that I can't imagine being without them.  They are even nice enough to wear with a suit on Sundays.  I previously had Hush Puppies and was looking to get them again but they were almost $100 more expensive.  So glad I bought these because they appear (to me at least) to be better constructed.

First let me tell you that I grew up playing competitive soccer. Puma and Adidas were the only brands I would ever wear. Puma however has always been my choice. The durability matching the comfort and style leaves no argument. Having said this, I'm obviously quite familiar with Puma. Now days I'm a bartender. I work on my feet. I ordered the Romas for work. Before then every day I got off work my feet hurt. As soon as I started wearing these shoes at work my foot aches stopped. They are light, comfortable and don't slip. I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone that works on their feet. Bartenders and servers especially! Solid black,industry standard. They don't slip and they wipe off clean with a warm wash cloth.

It's a good looking shoe but the size and the width are smaller than one would expect. I buy a lot of Puma shoes. They normally run true to size. This particular style runs narrow and at least a half size short in the length. It is truly disappointing. Unfortunately I trusted them to be correct and disposed of the box and materials immediately. Now I cant return them. I would recommend you heck closely order a half size larger, and if you have more than a medium width forget them all together.

I wanted to like these and got them for the classic look but they are not that comfortable. The leather is very thin and light combined with what I feel is a very thin and cheap sole with little to none arch support makes you feel you bought an knockoff shoe. Because of the thin soft leather and the extra narrow sole they tend to get wrinkles around the ball of your toes and curve of your arches. Definitely not a everyday shoe.

I'm a 10W, or 10.5, (wide feet.) I ordered 11's since I read that you should size-up. I did. I received them and they still felt a little too tight even though I bought 1 size bigger than I usually do. My boyfriend tried them on (he's a real size 11) and they did NOT fit him comfortably... he would have to buy a 12 if he wanted these to fit him. I'll wear them even though they're slightly snug on me, but I would not buy them again. If you want these, order 1.5 bigger than you usually and they'll still feel a little snug.

These are weird shoes, they don't seem shaped for human feet. I wear a 10 and ordered up a half size (10.5 D) --- the shoes are plenty long, but incredibly narrow. The ""fabric"" of the shoe is a fake leather that is more akin to plastic. The insole is virtually non-existent, the shoes are basically flat inside and provide no support, and the soles are cheapo, thin, and glued on rather than stitched. Terrible ventilation makes it feel like you're walking in a puddle when your feet start to sweat ... they don't breathe at all. I gave these 2 stars rather than 1 due to the low price, but honestly they're garbage for my needs so it's just $30 that I'll be throwing in the trash. NOT RECOMMENDED unless you have clown feet that never sweat.

I was specifically interested in the Romas because they had a ""leather upper for long wear and serious style"".  I ordered the shoes, on sale, from a participating Amazon vendor. My order was shipped and delivered as expected, but when I unwrapped the shoes, they had no leather... anywhere...  and the manufacturer's stickers stated ""other materials"".  I called Puma directly and was told that their shoes (as stated on their site) were made of leather and I should try to return them to Amazon for a leather pair.  I did so, thinking maybe a pair directly sourced from Amazon would be leather, as advertised.  I paid full price for the second pair of Romas (Black/NightShade/Orange... not my first color choice, but sourced and shipped directly from Amazon) and they were not leather either.  Very frustrated I called Puma again, and this time was told that the shoes on their site were only leather if they said ""Genuine Leather""!  Are you kidding me...?!?!  Talk about advertising that does not accurately represent the product.  Its great if you want to make animal friendly products, but call it what it is... synthetic!  DO NOT ORDER THESE IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT A LEATHER SHOE, YOU WILL RECEIVE ""OTHER MATERIAL"" SNEAKERS.

I love Puma and always get a 10.  My shoe size is typically a 9.5 in most other athletic shoes and a 10 in Nike.  These have a little room at the end of them, but they don't feel roomy since they do run a bit narrow.  It's like when I buy 33 pants to get a little extra in the legs when buying jeans sometimes.  I got the all whites and will try to wear them only in the warmer weather.  I've had many pairs of Romas and Whirlwinds and they're comfortable for the day.  All white's not really my thing, but for $32 you can't go wrong.  They go with everything.

Great looking classic. That's why I bought it but it's a terrible shoe. Flat. Hard. No support at all. Not something to wear if you have to be on your feet.

Okay for the money but I have now decided Pumas were not made for my feet.  They simply run too small and narrow for me.  I do like their styles though.  These are pleather in case you are wondering.  They are the man-made version of leather.  That, by itself, is not bad.  Puma just cannot make a shoe wide enough for me.  I like the way their driving mocs look and feel too but they are just too narrow.  By the time I find a shoe wide enough to wear comfortably, the shoe needs to be 8 feet long.  I don't know who can wear these things...

These are good shoes for casual wear and they look great. However they are NOT for standing on feet all day or running.  Had to add gel inserts but since they are a little more narrow than most they got a little tight. I just had to change laces because these were too short after I loosened them. overall good sneaker.

Not even close to the right size. Looked like a shoe for a child. Couldn't even try it on, I just opened the box and laughed. The return process was very easy and hassle-free, and refund was issued immediately. I'll be buying shoes exclusively in-person from now on.

I have these in Black as well and will base my experience review on those. I am a size 12 and flat footed, the sneakers fit great with thinner and sports socks.  I wore the black all summer with lots of walking in various conditions and environments.  Shoe is sturdy, holds form and has not stretched.  Sneaker shows very little sign of wear with heel looking like new and very little loss in cushioning.The only ""complain"" would be in driving.  Longer drives of 1 hour+ led to discomfort in my heels.

Nice shoes! But is way to small and tight.  I should have paid better attention to the reviews.  Toe are is more Narrow than the heel (very odd)... and the shoe itself I should have ordered 1 size up than normal.  My feet feel squished.  I will donate the shoes because I can barely fit my feet in them.

In the photo, the Roma size 10 is on the left, and a regular size 10 Puma is on the right.  No idea who can comfortably fit into this.  Maybe you're an average male needing a pair of shoes for your daughter.  Or maybe you need a place to store baby carrots in the fridge.  But these are not walking shoes made for men, unless those men are little people.

I have a narrow to medium size foot.  These shoes were more narrow than any shoe I have ever purchased.  Men’s size 11 and the heal was barely 2” wide.  I returned for refund because they did not have the wide width (that I normally never need).

Cool looking/feeling shoes. Trustable brand name. Not that expensive either. Just got them but it didn't take long to break them in. I can't speak to longevity of them but if they stay comfortable for a while it was well worth the buy. If they don't I'm sure an insole change would solve your problem. I like how they look like old school Basketball shoes before they all started going high-tops.

Clean and sharp casual shoes. Comfy, but narrow. Make sure to buy at least a half-size larger than your usual shoe size. For comparison, I wear a 10 1/2 in my Nike Air and Jordan AF1's, so I bought a size 11 for this pair.Delivered within 2 days. Packaging is legit Puma.

This product is garbage I have sevral different colours in this sneakers wanted a black saw it on Amazon nd I purchased the size I ordered fits too small even though the ones I have in other colours are the same size . My other sneakers like this are extremely comforTble and can be worn all day this is hard and not very comfortable . I tried taking out the insoles and it glued to the bottom of the sneakers ( between what I have now and gone through I have over 70 pairs of puma ) and taking out the insoles is easy ( it’s never glued to the bottom ) this is my second to last pair in the last two weeks and that pair taking out the insoles was easy .

Puma's are my favorite shoe to wear because they are PERFECT for my feet!  It's like they were designed around my own foot width and size.  I have always had a wider foot and these have been one of the better shoes for support and overall comfort.  I highly recommend Puma's for anyone that has just a tad wider foot than normal and wants a very comfortable shoe!  Oh, and the prices are very hard to beat when found on sale, they are $35 and below for some of the more popular styles.

As other reviews have stated, they do run small, I would definitely order a half size larger than usual. I'm glad I listened to their advice. (Even a whole size of you have wide feet). They are a little narrow, so keep that in mind when ordering. Other than that, they seem to be a well made shoe, and are comfortably breaking in, we'll see how they hold up over time.

First off, I love these shoes.  They are super comfortable and look great. I would have no problem at all giving this shoe five stars...except they are misrepresented in the product description.

Having said that, they are supremely comfortable and I would recommend them to anyone.  Minus one star for the deceptive product description.

These looked awesome in the pics on the web & looked very similar to the severely beat-up Pumas I inherited from my younger brother a few years ago. I guess I was just being overly optimistic, despite having read several ""narrow"" warning reviews. I received them and knew immediately they were no good.I waited for my wife to come home and showed them to her, she agreed that they were waaay too narrow, especially for my feet. I have wider than normal feet. These were not so comfortable. Plus, my wide feet were immediately starting to warp the inner walls of the shoe & made it look like it was collapsing outwardly. I thought to myself is this normal? Will this go away/ normalize over time? I ran to the garage & grabbed a somewhat newer, other pair of Pumas I own. They are much wider than these & fit me much more comfortably and normally. I ended up returning these for a refund the next day.Now, I did take very accurate measurements of these & compared the numbers to that other similar beat-up pair. They were all VERY similar, but comparing these to that other wider pair of Pumas I own, there were some differences. Plus, those are a hundred times more comfortable. I gave up on finding a new pair of Pumas & wore flip-flops everywhere for 6 months after this, Lol :D

I've had worn Roma's for many years, I can say close to 10 years straight...Has the material or anything else changed?

My son loves this shoe.  If fits like it should. I'm glad to had found a shop open to purchase a shoe for my son.. who's foot seemed to had jump from an 12 &1/2 mens to an 14 over night. Yall saved my life..

I ordered these for my husband since he will only wear pumas and i love the price. However the shoe itself is a lot narrower than any of his other pumas have ever been. Especially in the toes. He is still wearing them for now but i suspect he wont put up with it for long.

Disappointed that it's so hard to find leather shoes anymore on here. Shoes fit, they don't last long since they're not leather. I had bought him a black pair for work before these that weren't leather either, and they've already been trashed. Maybe the description said it wasn't leather, if so, my mistake. Hubs needed white shoes in a hurry. Live and learn.

I just got these and they're so narrow. I just took them off because they were so tight. The blood circulation was getting cut off. I wear an 11.5 and the length was right on, but not the width. I'm probably going to choose another shoe, instead of a higher size. I just think this shoe is designed to be narrow. The design is good and I like it, but i can't make it work.

The style is white sneaks with gum. You gotta rock these with some slim jeans above the ankle. So fly

The bottom of the shoe is very slippery. It's not a soft rubber like most sneakers. It's a harder more slick material. Tough on wet stairs. This may resolve itself as the shoe breaks in.

I really like the clean lines of this sneaker. Looks great and is comfortable. Took a few days to adjust to my foot. Would be great if there was a 10.5 "" WIDE size but i didn't see that option. I would consider getting half an inch larger than my normal size next time.

I read the reviews Saying they’re narrow  before I purchased.  I thought “how bad can they be?”  Yes I see now after Trying them on.  They are vary narrow even buying a size larger than normal. So Here i had an inch of space between my toes and front of shoe yet my sides were bulging out so bad it was painful and I was waiting for them to tear on me. Needless to say I returned them. Have no idea why puma would make such a narrow shoe

The shoe itself is amazing, beaituful but def smaller then 9.5 i wear normally and not even a little bit smaller, i won't be able to walk long distance with them, do sports.

I have a wide foot so I ordered one size larger than I normally wear.I chose Puma because I had worn them back in the 70's (seriously, the blue suede ones)They have become cheaper in feel on my feet, not the solid comfort and support I thought I remembered.Still look good, price was reasonable with free shipping.Will have to see how long they last.

For 30 bucks on prime days was worth a shot. They look cool but they are way to narrow to actually wear all day.  I even ordered 1/2 size larger assuming would help. I'm gonna wear them around house and hopefully break them in but looks like I am back to wearing Reebok Classics.

Lately, I'm favoring PUMA over many other brands of sneakers.The size fit as expected. The shoe feels somewhat flimsily put together, but they are very lightweight and comfortable. Moreover, the shoe looks good with most types of casual pants including skinny jeans, straight legs, Levis 501 and 550, or cargo pants. I only wish they came with thicker laces, but a trip to Modell's easily remedies that gripe. Oh, I bought the white/black style, so cleaning was required almost after the first wear. For this reason, I limit how often I wear them, and consider WHERE I'm going to be wearing them.

These Puma shoes are comfortable and stylish. I have bought the same pair year after year because of the reliability in quality and size.

I try to briskly walk (not run) at least five miles a day, on average, for exercise, almost entirely on pavement (sidewalks).  After using them for about three weeks, I can report that the Puma Romas seem perfect for this, well-fitting, light-weight, and giving me no problems at all, not even during the initial breaking-them-in phase.  As things stand right now, this'll be my brand and model for the rest of my walking life.

Comfy, not a lot of padding if your feet need extra support. The tongue is kind of hard and pokes into your leg. Hoping that goes away as we break them in.

This sneaker deserves a 5 🌟 yes, its appearance is very smart and gives the individual wearing it a matured yet casual look, however in my case i rate it a 3 🌟 reason being i have a wide foot and its currently to Narrow so its totally uncomfortable to walk on.

I have a number of Puma shoes and they have been satisfactory in the past. The length  of these was fine but the width is narrow.Unfortunately, despite the description, they are definitely not leather. In years past, people answered the question about the upper material by saying at that time it was leather. There is no material tag on the tongue but a paper label inside says “other material “ textile lining.It doesn’t look/feel like leather and the narrow fit won’t stretch. Disappointed by the deceptive text. These are going to be returned.

I have 7 pair of puma sneakers.  the fit is perfect.  Great style.  This particular sneaker, although a great style, I had a problem with the fit.  Usually puma is unisex.

The shoe looks great, but I wouldn't recommend these for daily use or for a long day of walking.

Disappointed that the shoes shipped are actually NOT leather.  I don't know if Puma has changed this recently; or if there is a real leather version still alongside a ""cheaper"" version.  Rightly or wrongly, my head went straight to ""are these genuine Puma or nasty fakes?"".The fake leather feels right and I wouldn't have known were it not for the labeling.  Guess we'll see how they last.  My last real leather pair of these lasted several years with frequent wear.

I've been fairly loyal to Puma in the past, but over time something changed.I've always worn a men's size 14, and had numerous pairs of Puma shoes over the years that fit me comfortably. For some reason, the last several pairs of Pumas I've ordered have been too small, to the point where they feel like a 13.In this shoe, as well as others, my toe will be against the end of the shoe inside, and the top of the shoe presses down uncomfortably on the top of my foot in the area of the joint between the metatarsal and the phalanges.Not sure why, but Puma's sizing seems to run small these days when it never used to.
"
8032,"
Unless you have really narrow feet, order a size up. I wear a 13 in just about any brand and style and these were way too tight. Got the 14 and they’re great! Just enough arch support so they don’t feel like flats like Converse All-Stars.
"

First pair arrived defective, but Amazon made it right and I got a second pair. Hopefully it's not a sign of long term durability issues. I really like them so far. Classic look shoes that feel good, if you like simple low sole shoes (ie. Not much cushion). I wear them to my desk job and on the shop floor, and coach my kids soccer team in them.

Really dope shoe. Good quality, looks fresh (imo). Runs small though. Like a whole size small (order 1 size up!). I wear mens 8.5 in nikes, adidas skate shoes, work boots, and more.

These shoes are a little longer than my usual fit. This is probably because they are intended for men. I can still wear them comfortably and will be able to wear them with thicker socks this fall. If you are a female ordering these and like a tighter fit, I recommend going down a 1/2 size.
"

Bought these shoes because I thought they'd make for a good driving shoe, and they do. They are compact and fit in the pedal box nicely, without catching on pedals or other stuff. Only issue is that yeah, as others have noted: these run a little small. I returned a size 8 1/2 (which are usually perfect for me) and got a size 9. The 8 1/2 were way too tight. The 9 fits as intended. As a walking shoe, I'm not sure I'd recommend these. They are comfortable but have flat soles and very little padding on the sole. Also the arch is somewhat prominent on the inside of my foot. Kinda strange feeling. For what I wanted, though they're perfect.

I typically wear size 10 U.S., I ordered a U.S. size 10.5, I felt it's better for the shoes to arrive and be a bit larger than necessary rather than smaller, as some shoe brands do. The U.S. size 10.5 actually turned out to be smaller and tighter I than what I am comfortably able to wear.

The shoes took a while to arrive due to be back-ordered.  They fit pretty well overall, but not super comfortable as I was hoping for.

I wear a 10.5 in Nike, Clark's, Cole Hann, Converse, etc. I ordered this in a 10.5 and they were way too small, so I went a half size up to 11 and they are still just way too small. The toe box is very narrow and tight around the base of my toes. My toes were also still crunched up against the front a bit. It's just really strange to have such different sizes from every other mainstream company. It makes it very difficult to shop for the product online, when you have to keep exchanging them just to try it on.

Idk what’s up with these shoes but when I ordered them it said men’s. When I got them the invoice says women’s. And it seems like a women’s size 14 instead of a men’s.

"
8097,"
Love the fit, pumas run a little small (about 0.5 US men's) but I anticipated this and ordered the correct size. They hug my feet and don't cram my toes. They feel very responsive when I board.My one issue is that the thick leather sometimes pushes down on my toes while the shoe bends as I walk. This hurts a little but adjusting the tongue eases this. -1 star for this.Oddly, the shoes are advertised as mens, but when I added them to my cart they were shown as women's. However the shoes did in fact come in men's size.
"
8098,"
Fits on the small side (1/2 size smaller than most other brands), but super comfortable, and everything you should expect for the quality. Puma has one of the most interesting stories of any company, much less shoe brands, and would encourage anyone unfamiliar to read their history.

The shoe size is one point smaller than you order.  The size that you order is listed on the label under the tongue.

I've had these sneakers for over a year now and they never broke in the way I hoped they would. They are very uncomfortable and offer no support for my feet at all. All I needed them to be was my every day comfy go to chill-out shoe. My feet start to hurt after having them on for an hour, and I'm not going to buy inserts for a shoe that should be comfortable already.... especially after breaking them in. The shoes are still intact and look good broken in, but I'm still donating them as I need to choose comfort over style.
"
8107,"
Rarely wear an 11.5, but in this case the advice in the comments held true - size up a half size! The 11.5s fit me like an average 11 and were not visibly longer than Adidas Samba 11s.Love the fit and simple look. Fit my somewhat-wide feet better than Sambas. Snug, with no hotspots or pinches like I had with brand new Sambas. Thought I was a Sambas person but turns out I have perfectly Super Liga OG-shaped feet. The material inside the heel upper does squeak a bit, fresh out of the box, but I will sacrifice the element of surprise to Comfort and Comedy. Not gonna wear these to a funeral or reading library until they get broken in though.

I loved these shoes! I love a flat sole with no arch support and no tread (which these are) but not even 3 months after purchase the sole has an annoying bubble on both sides, where the glue has come undone from outer sole and inner support sole. And there's a hole on the side where the toe bends! I'd expect this from a cheap off-brand overseas shoe but not PUMA. I wore them an average of 4hrs everyday for 2.5months doing normal day to day activities (no running, no indoor soccer, no track, etc)...I expected better, do not recommend, I will not purchase again.
"
8127,"
I like the look of this shoe, I wish it was more comfortable.  Going to give it some time and try to break them in some, maybe soften the leather.  So far, it’s a snug fit.  I’m usually a women’s 10.5-11.  I ordered a Men’s 9.5.  The tightness throughout the shoe is just really snug, but the part that is discouraging to wear is the tongue.  The leather is hard and is rubbing into my ankle, wearing a sock beyond the tongue has helped some.  Similar to a Birkenstock strap that has hard edges until you break it in-but hits right at the front of the ankle.  Like my purchase, wish it were more comfortable, very slim look/fit, hoping once it is broken in it will feel better.

The shoes look better than they feel.  They have very little support.

They're a great looking shoes for the cost. The leather makes them great for rainy or cold days. The soles are thin and feel a bit cheap, but they may start to feel better after I put some miles on them.Beware, these shoes run thin as far as fit, so if you have wide hairy hobbit feet you may want to avoid these shoes or try a larger size than usual.

I love the super liga shoes. I have had multiple pairs. I bought this pair to replace my old pair. It's soft, durable, and comfortable. I have worn these for indoor soccer, work, and as a casual everyday shoe. This is a pretty flat shoe, but if you aren't concerned with a big arch, they remain comfortable. With time the leather will stretch a little bit, so I typically wear them around the house for a few days to break them in. The Navy looks great in person; I was skeptical from the photo. I would recommend to anyone that is looking for one of the above.

My first pair of Pumas were the Liga version.  Wore them for 13+ years and still have them.  Love them but can’t find them anymore.  This is a great alternative.  Very close to the original Liga style.  Some of the outside patches are not suede like the original Liga version but still looks great.  Feels and wears just like my other Puma shoes.  By the way I am pretty sure these are boys shoes and not women’s but either way I love them.  I’ve seen at least two other men wearing these as well.

I am a size 8.5/9 regularly in women's shoes. I read the reviews and bought the 7 size. They fit really good. I also have wide feet so I was worried but they look good. Also, I can see why they call them navy. Even though look black out of the box and on your foot.... when I set them next to my other shoes that are truly black, they look like a very dark navy. I think this should help solve any concerns before buying. I really like them and am glad I bought them.

Toes are smashed in there. The fabric isn't rounded for the height of your toes. Over a few days of shoving stuff in the shoes I managed to stretch the toe fabric, but still too narrow width. Disappointed. I previously bought Puma King Avantis that were the same size and fit great. But those, while they looked like football shoes, didn't hold up to one kickabout before the bottom started peeling apart. Handsome shoes but I'm done buying Pumas.

These sneakers are very comfortable and very nice, with a decades old classic design.  I actually bought the navy ones first and just got the white ones too.

I really like the look of Pumas and these are no exception - they are sleek and have a low profile. However, the toe box on these is too tight, there is little arch support, and the gum sole is a little stiff. I would recommend ordering a half size larger and adding a soft insole.

I bought this pair to replace an identical pair that I had worn constantly for many years. They are among the most comfortable, nicest fitting every day shoe I have ever worn and so when those were starting to look in rough shape it was an easy decision to replace them with the same pair.When they arrived, they felt a little bit different but I figured it just needed to be broken in and after a few weeks they felt as comfortable as usual. However, within about six weeks, the front of the sole on each shoe started to separate. It wasn't really noticeable at first, only really when you took them off at the end of a day. Now, three months later, the sole has almost entirely separated from the shoe and the shoes cannot even be worn.I don't know what changed between now and the last time I got these, but the first pair lasted five years and a TON of wear with zero trouble. Three months of every other day or so wear, especially when I am working from home and not going anywhere that often, is unacceptable.

I really wanted to like these OG’s even to the extent of trying on three different sizes. Ultimately the shoes are shoddily made and just so not fit right for me.Other than trying to relive my youth I need more supportive and better made sneakers. There is no support, the shoes appear to be very very cheaply made (if unbranded I would have not given them a second look) and other than the retro coolness I would recommend passing on these … unless you are just looking for the retro-ness as your primary concern.

Revisando el articulo por dentro me deja mis dudas serias que sean originales. Siguiendo recomendaciones de algunos comentarios pedí un número más al normal que uso y aun así se nota que la orma del ancho es un poco estrecho la punta es muy larga por lo que me queda bien de ancho pero de largo un poco larguito.

The suede might be real but the white upper is not leather. That explains the price, I guess. But, the shoe does not stretch to break in to fit your foot. I've tried all the usual tricks, they do not stretch. No arch support, btw.

My husband just got his second pair of these,orginally got them as an adidas substitute.  The navy blue is very dark so looks almost black.  He says the shoes take some breaking in, but once that happens, they are moccasin-comfortable and very durable.  They will stretch just a bit.  He loves them! These are sized in U.S. and U.K. sizes, so get what's right for you.

Order a FULL size up. Just returned the second pair. Started out with a US 10.5 (men's). Those were way too small in the toe.

Good lord, these are the narrowest shoes. I have ordinary feet, but when I put these on, I felt like some poor Chinese girl from centuries past subjected to foot-binding.Traded in for a half-size up, and still uncomfortably tight.

I tryed to get this shoe 3 times. The listing says women's shoes so I ordered a woman's size. The 1st pair was to small. So I went up a hole size. The 2nd pair was way to big. So I went down a half size. 3rd pair still way to big. I gave up when I realized the 2nd & 3rd pair they had sent me was in a man's size. Which is way larger than women's sizes. If you order a 6 1/2 & under you will get a woman's size shoe. If you order a size 7 & up they will send you a man's size shoe. Not cool shoe people not cool at all.

First of all, these shoes feel really small, even if you order a size up. They feel really tight around your feet. They are made for little leprechaun feet. Second of all, the tongue is a cheap material that causes a loud squeaking noise when it rubs against the rest of the shoe. This is something I've noticed a lot lately with certain Adidas and Puma sneakers. Companies are cutting corners and giving you low-quality sneakers that loudly squeak when you wear them. Take my advice and don't buy these shoes.

These shoes have been a nightmare.  First off, its confusing because the box will have a US size but the shoe will have a UK size so it looks like youre getting the wrong size.  My boyfriend swears by them so I thought I’d get them to when they were on sale here.  They run very small.  My normal size is 10.5 but the 10.5 were way too tight.

I bought these as a gift, and the recipient loved them. They're a great looking shoe with the vintage styling of older designs. The shoe is very flat, not any arch to speak of, and the sole is pretty hard with a very thin insole. I saw a lot of reviews stating that the shoe size was not the size ordered or the size written on the box, and I think I know why...there is a sticker on the insole that displays the European size, which is one size less than American sizing, example: you order a shoe in 9.5 US, and the big gold sticker says 8.5 (it also specifies that it's the European size in smaller print)... don't worry about that sticker because there's also a label on the tongue which states the size in US, EU, and something else that I don't remember. Some people may have gotten the wrong size shoe, but most probably just saw that sticker and didn't realize that it was the EU size and their shoe was actually the right size. That sole may also need to be trimmed to fit the shoe better. Just know what you're getting, don't expect the best quality ever from a $50 shoe, realize that this shoe is more for looks and probably not the best thing to wear all day long, and you'll probably enjoy the shoe for what it is...a great looking shoe

The size was incorrect. There was no size chart when you’re ordering these shoes. It’s all in US sizing. We go by the UK sizing a there was no indication to that. The women’s US size chart varies to the US men’s sizing chart! It’s ridiculous and frustrating and it should clearly state the UK to US and EUR sizing chart.

Bought this for driving a manual transmission car at autocross events (not soccer/football). Purchased the puma liga and the adidas samba for comparison.Size - went up 1/2 in both shoes from my normal. Puma fits perfectly but adidas is slightly big.Quality - adidas samba is 20% higher quality than the puma liga, it’s just beefier construction all around (which is actually bad for what I want as a driving shoe). Notice the shot of the insoles and you can see that puma has a lighter weight and thunder construction. The sole of the puma liga is noticeably more flexible than the adidas samba. Push them against each other and the puma fold while the adidas barely moves.Design - I prefer the look of the puma. And I very much prefer the heel cup of the puma, which has a tacky leather that holds well as compared to the adidas which is fabric and resulted in my heel slipping as I walked. The tongue of the adidas samba is also huge - I know it’s for soccer, but dang.I’ll be keeping the puma ligas in 1/2 size up from normal. Quality is good for the price and they just feel better.

I really like the look and vibe of these shoes. Note that they are super loud and squeeky. This is from the tongue rubbing against the inside. I solved it by lightly sanding the inside where the tongue meets the shoe. Easy fix, but it was really annoyingly loud before this. Now nice and quiet.  So I hated them a few days ago and now like them again. I'll see if it stays that way. May have been my socks, but on a hot day recently they did feel a bit stuffy and warm, jury still out on ventilation... but maybe take note for those with sweaty feet.

Shoes seems to be good quality.  This is supped to be US size 8.5 but box states US 8.5 but inside was UK 8.5 or US 9.5. It is too long and wide.For most part US 8.5 is 42 Europe. So I re-ordered 9, which is 42 Europe according to the sizing chart.Hoping it will fit.

The shoe looks great, wished it would have fit great, I wear a 12 normal, and these were just way too narrow. They also lacked support, which I would have ignored if the width would have been acceptable. Sadly, I had to return these, and there is no larger half size available.

I love the way they look! Unfortunately, the rigid leather tongue jabbed into the top of my foot with every step. I tried them on with no-show socks first and that was a no. With thick athletic socks they don't cut into my ankle, but I just don't like long socks. I will have to return.

I bought a pair of these new and the sole split and delaminated at the front after about 4 weeks. Obviously, Puma changed the composition of the sole because once I had a pair of Ligas that lasted for about 4 years. I’ll never buy another Puma product.

Absolutely love the shoes!!! However I order a US 6.5 since I’m a Euro 37 and they were wayyyy to large and the euro said 38.5 on the tag.

Really poor update compared to the classic suede Liga that Puma used to make. The uppers are no longer suede, the sides are no longer padded, and the wide toe box is now narrow.  The old ones looked better, were way more comfortable and didn't need any breaking in. These feel and look cheap, not the same shoe at all as the old Ligas. A big downgrade. I hope they bring the old, all suede, better built Ligas back.

I bought these shoes on Monday and received them on Tuesday and was charged $59.83 but I ordered another pair today because my husband plays pickleball and racquetball and loved these shoes.

These are amongst my favorite shoes. They work well for driving, but the gum sole is also suitable for walking and running. They are moderately padded, but you can't use heavily padded shoes for driving, for instance. Also, I love the classic, timeless styling. The fit is good; a sticker on the bottom of the shoe says 9, but they are 10 in US size. (9 must be the UK size...) I generally wear 10-sized shoes with thick socks and 9.5 with no socks or thin socks. The ten size fits me perfectly.

Second pair of adidas this style.  My first pair were approximately 7 years old, got lots of use from them.  They developed cracked in the sole from the rubber drying out, no big deal.These look good, ok for street use.  I wouldn’t wear these for jogging or a strenuous workout.  Width, as mentioned over and over in the reviews is narrow.  If you’re between sizes, size up.

Originally a fan of the OG Adidas Sambas, but these Pumas do just fine for my needs. They look amazing and handle well for breakdancing and skating. Nice overall pair of shoes for everyday usage, and I would recommend them to anyone. Definitely worth it, especially for under 40 dollars.

If there's ever an arbitrage scenario on Amazon, this is it. The men's version of these shoes are $30 more expensive and they are EXACTLY the same shoe. I love them and am glad I was able to get for a discount because I stumbled on the ""women's"" version.

I ordered a 10 and the shoe in the box said 9. It was small. I returned it thinking they sent me the wrong size. I re-ordered and the same thing happened. Pretty sure the size in the shoe is UK size. Still runs small. Need to re-order again a half size bigger.

Bought these at another store- but i wear a 12 and they fit. People reported tight fit; and very true as they narrow (5th toe) and need some breaking in time ; but the area, where the ball of your foot lies to outer side (medial to lateral) is wide and has a toe that tapers at 20-25 degrees to foot apex. They do fit differently vs other puma shoe standards and have a slight creaking plasticity sound to them new (Not suede like regular pumas. More like a synthetic leather) so minus -1 star. It will get quiet w wear and comfort; as this my 2nd pair. If they rub where your pinky (5th) toe is u need to size 1/2 up (taper of shoe) but this is just a suggestion.Tongue is very low in these- fyi.For under $50 they give an alternative retro style.Quality noted from textiles made in thailand imo.

Un calzado bueno y a buen precio, dice que es piel. Pero no creo que sea una piel de buena calidad, me gusta más la piel de los adidas samba, y el logo de puma negro ese al parecer no es de piel. Si se ve vinipiel muy económica, me quedo bien, no aprieta ni es grande, pero es un sneaker bastante duro por dentro y la. Suela es pura goma, la lengüeta es bastante corta lo cual llega a lastimar la piel con el rose de la lengüeta con el pie, en lo personal me agrada más el adidas samba ya que es un poco más cómodo, en nivel interior y se ve mejor calidad en la piel!

I have always been an Adidas Samba guy.  From wearing them around town to playing indoor soccer.  I'd wear and completely abuse the *&^% out of them and they'd last.  Boy, would they last.  As of late, it is impossible to find size 10 REAL Adidas Samba OG in Canada (Adidas you suck!).  I have always known about these sweet looking Puma Super Ligas.After reading reviews and, frankly, being petrified of ordering them due to sizing and overall quality concerns, I bit the bullet and bought them.  If anything was wrong with them, I could return them and they were $80 Canadian taxes in.They came yesterday.  I have to say, the material seems to be leather on the upper.  At least parts of it, so that was one sigh of relief.  It actually has the leather sticker stuck on the insole for what that's worth.  And it kind of smells like leather.  Sigh of relief two, they fit like a dream after ordering HALF A SIZE UP - that is key.  I'm a ten in Sambas and pretty much all shoes with very wide, hideous feet and these babies in a 10.5 fit like a dream.  The Sambas tend to be tight on me for the first month until the REAL leather stretches to perfection around my Hobbit-like feet.Now for what I expected and a negative.  The soles oh the soles....they are thin.  I guess because so many reviews mentioned how thin they were, I feel like I have to gingerly walk on them and not drag my feet with fear of any tread being removed and me Fred Flintstone walking on skin.  So would I wear these for their initial intention back when Madonna was creating new hits (indoor soccer), absolutely not.  They will be worn daily for work and walking about, but nothing too rigorous.We will see how they hold up in the year(s) to come.  I'm still nervous.  I usually get 3 years out my Sambas.

I've been fairly loyal to Puma in the past, but over time something changed.I've always worn a men's size 14, and had numerous pairs of Puma shoes over the years that fit me comfortably. For some reason, the last several pairs of Pumas I've ordered have been too small, to the point where they feel like a 13.In this shoe, as well as others, my toe will be against the end of the shoe inside, and the top of the shoe presses down uncomfortably on the top of my foot in the area of the joint between the metatarsal and the phalanges.Not sure why, but Puma's sizing seems to run small these days when it never used to.
"
8571,"
Unless you have really narrow feet, order a size up. I wear a 13 in just about any brand and style and these were way too tight. Got the 14 and they’re great! Just enough arch support so they don’t feel like flats like Converse All-Stars.
"

First pair arrived defective, but Amazon made it right and I got a second pair. Hopefully it's not a sign of long term durability issues. I really like them so far. Classic look shoes that feel good, if you like simple low sole shoes (ie. Not much cushion). I wear them to my desk job and on the shop floor, and coach my kids soccer team in them.

Really dope shoe. Good quality, looks fresh (imo). Runs small though. Like a whole size small (order 1 size up!). I wear mens 8.5 in nikes, adidas skate shoes, work boots, and more. I ordered a 9 cause I read they ran a bit small. It's still too small. I thought it fit good until I started walking all day in them while at university. It's bearable, but it gets tight in the toe box after a while. Order a size up!

These shoes are a little longer than my usual fit. This is probably because they are intended for men. I can still wear them comfortably and will be able to wear them with thicker socks this fall. If you are a female ordering these and like a tighter fit, I recommend going down a 1/2 size.

Bought these shoes because I thought they'd make for a good driving shoe, and they do. They are compact and fit in the pedal box nicely, without catching on pedals or other stuff. Only issue is that yeah, as others have noted: these run a little small. I returned a size 8 1/2 (which are usually perfect for me) and got a size 9. The 8 1/2 were way too tight. The 9 fits as intended. As a walking shoe, I'm not sure I'd recommend these. They are comfortable but have flat soles and very little padding on the sole. Also the arch is somewhat prominent on the inside of my foot. Kinda strange feeling. For what I wanted, though they're perfect.

I typically wear size 10 U.S., I ordered a U.S. size 10.5, I felt it's better for the shoes to arrive and be a bit larger than necessary rather than smaller, as some shoe brands do. The U.S. size 10.5 actually turned out to be smaller and tighter I than what I am comfortably able to wear.

The shoes took a while to arrive due to be back-ordered.  They fit pretty well overall, but not super comfortable as I was hoping for.

I wear a 10.5 in Nike, Clark's, Cole Hann, Converse, etc. I ordered this in a 10.5 and they were way too small, so I went a half size up to 11 and they are still just way too small. The toe box is very narrow and tight around the base of my toes. My toes were also still crunched up against the front a bit. It's just really strange to have such different sizes from every other mainstream company. It makes it very difficult to shop for the product online, when you have to keep exchanging them just to try it on.

Idk what’s up with these shoes but when I ordered them it said men’s. When I got them the invoice says women’s. And it seems like a women’s size 14 instead of a men’s.

"
8636,"
Love the fit, pumas run a little small (about 0.5 US men's) but I anticipated this and ordered the correct size. They hug my feet and don't cram my toes. They feel very responsive when I board.My one issue is that the thick leather sometimes pushes down on my toes while the shoe bends as I walk. This hurts a little but adjusting the tongue eases this. -1 star for this.Oddly, the shoes are advertised as mens, but when I added them to my cart they were shown as women's. However the shoes did in fact come in men's size.
"
8637,"
Fits on the small side (1/2 size smaller than most other brands), but super comfortable, and everything you should expect for the quality. Puma has one of the most interesting stories of any company, much less shoe brands, and would encourage anyone unfamiliar to read their history.

The shoe size is one point smaller than you order.  The size that you order is listed on the label under the tongue.

I've had these sneakers for over a year now and they never broke in the way I hoped they would. They are very uncomfortable and offer no support for my feet at all. All I needed them to be was my every day comfy go to chill-out shoe. My feet start to hurt after having them on for an hour, and I'm not going to buy inserts for a shoe that should be comfortable already.... especially after breaking them in. The shoes are still intact and look good broken in, but I'm still donating them as I need to choose comfort over style.
"
8646,"
Rarely wear an 11.5, but in this case the advice in the comments held true - size up a half size! The 11.5s fit me like an average 11 and were not visibly longer than Adidas Samba 11s.Love the fit and simple look. Fit my somewhat-wide feet better than Sambas. Snug, with no hotspots or pinches like I had with brand new Sambas. Thought I was a Sambas person but turns out I have perfectly Super Liga OG-shaped feet. The material inside the heel upper does squeak a bit, fresh out of the box, but I will sacrifice the element of surprise to Comfort and Comedy. Not gonna wear these to a funeral or reading library until they get broken in though.

I loved these shoes! I love a flat sole with no arch support and no tread (which these are) but not even 3 months after purchase the sole has an annoying bubble on both sides, where the glue has come undone from outer sole and inner support sole. And there's a hole on the side where the toe bends! I'd expect this from a cheap off-brand overseas shoe but not PUMA. I wore them an average of 4hrs everyday for 2.5months doing normal day to day activities (no running, no indoor soccer, no track, etc)...I expected better, do not recommend, I will not purchase again.
"
8666,"
I like the look of this shoe, I wish it was more comfortable.  Going to give it some time and try to break them in some, maybe soften the leather.  So far, it’s a snug fit.  I’m usually a women’s 10.5-11.  I ordered a Men’s 9.5.  The tightness throughout the shoe is just really snug, but the part that is discouraging to wear is the tongue.  The leather is hard and is rubbing into my ankle, wearing a sock beyond the tongue has helped some.  Similar to a Birkenstock strap that has hard edges until you break it in-but hits right at the front of the ankle.  Like my purchase, wish it were more comfortable, very slim look/fit, hoping once it is broken in it will feel better.
"
8667,"
The shoes look better than they feel.  They have very little support.

They're a great looking shoes for the cost. The leather makes them great for rainy or cold days. The soles are thin and feel a bit cheap, but they may start to feel better after I put some miles on them.Beware, these shoes run thin as far as fit, so if you have wide hairy hobbit feet you may want to avoid these shoes or try a larger size than usual.

I love the super liga shoes. I have had multiple pairs. I bought this pair to replace my old pair. It's soft, durable, and comfortable. I have worn these for indoor soccer, work, and as a casual everyday shoe. This is a pretty flat shoe, but if you aren't concerned with a big arch, they remain comfortable. With time the leather will stretch a little bit, so I typically wear them around the house for a few days to break them in. The Navy looks great in person; I was skeptical from the photo. I would recommend to anyone that is looking for one of the above.

My first pair of Pumas were the Liga version.  Wore them for 13+ years and still have them.  Love them but can’t find them anymore.  This is a great alternative.  Very close to the original Liga style.  Some of the outside patches are not suede like the original Liga version but still looks great.  Feels and wears just like my other Puma shoes.

I am a size 8.5/9 regularly in women's shoes. I read the reviews and bought the 7 size. They fit really good. I also have wide feet so I was worried but they look good. Also, I can see why they call them navy. Even though look black out of the box and on your foot.... when I set them next to my other shoes that are truly black, they look like a very dark navy. I think this should help solve any concerns before buying. I really like them and am glad I bought them.

Toes are smashed in there. The fabric isn't rounded for the height of your toes. Over a few days of shoving stuff in the shoes I managed to stretch the toe fabric, but still too narrow width. Disappointed. I previously bought Puma King Avantis that were the same size and fit great. But those, while they looked like football shoes, didn't hold up to one kickabout before the bottom started peeling apart. Handsome shoes but I'm done buying Pumas.

These sneakers are very comfortable and very nice, with a decades old classic design.  I actually bought the navy ones first and just got the white ones too.

I really like the look of Pumas and these are no exception - they are sleek and have a low profile. However, the toe box on these is too tight, there is little arch support, and the gum sole is a little stiff. I would recommend ordering a half size larger and adding a soft insole.

I bought this pair to replace an identical pair that I had worn constantly for many years. They are among the most comfortable, nicest fitting every day shoe I have ever worn and so when those were starting to look in rough shape it was an easy decision to replace them with the same pair.When they arrived, they felt a little bit different but I figured it just needed to be broken in and after a few weeks they felt as comfortable as usual. However, within about six weeks, the front of the sole on each shoe started to separate. It wasn't really noticeable at first, only really when you took them off at the end of a day. Now, three months later, the sole has almost entirely separated from the shoe and the shoes cannot even be worn.I don't know what changed between now and the last time I got these, but the first pair lasted five years and a TON of wear with zero trouble. Three months of every other day or so wear, especially when I am working from home and not going anywhere that often, is unacceptable.

Nice shoe, I wouldn’t want to stand a really long time, but I wear them casually. Do size up or you’ll be sending them back! They look great and versatile in style.

I really wanted to like these OG’s even to the extent of trying on three different sizes. Ultimately the shoes are shoddily made and just so not fit right for me.Other than trying to relive my youth I need more supportive and better made sneakers. There is no support, the shoes appear to be very very cheaply made (if unbranded I would have not given them a second look) and other than the retro coolness I would recommend passing on these … unless you are just looking for the retro-ness as your primary concern.

Revisando el articulo por dentro me deja mis dudas serias que sean originales. Siguiendo recomendaciones de algunos comentarios pedí un número más al normal que uso y aun así se nota que la orma del ancho es un poco estrecho la punta es muy larga por lo que me queda bien de ancho pero de largo un poco larguito.

The suede might be real but the white upper is not leather. That explains the price, I guess. But, the shoe does not stretch to break in to fit your foot. I've tried all the usual tricks, they do not stretch. No arch support, btw.

My husband just got his second pair of these,orginally got them as an adidas substitute.  The navy blue is very dark so looks almost black.  He says the shoes take some breaking in, but once that happens, they are moccasin-comfortable and very durable.  They will stretch just a bit.  He loves them! These are sized in U.S. and U.K. sizes, so get what's right for you.

Order a FULL size up. Just returned the second pair. Started out with a US 10.5 (men's). Those were way too small in the toe. Exchanged for an 11, and my toes are still pushing up against the end of the shoe. I just processed the return, and this time I wasn't even given the option to exchange. Refund only. Too bad.

Good lord, these are the narrowest shoes. I have ordinary feet, but when I put these on, I felt like some poor Chinese girl from centuries past subjected to foot-binding.Traded in for a half-size up, and still uncomfortably tight.

I tryed to get this shoe 3 times. The listing says women's shoes so I ordered a woman's size. The 1st pair was to small. So I went up a hole size. The 2nd pair was way to big. So I went down a half size. 3rd pair still way to big. I gave up when I realized the 2nd & 3rd pair they had sent me was in a man's size. Which is way larger than women's sizes. If you order a 6 1/2 & under you will get a woman's size shoe. If you order a size 7 & up they will send you a man's size shoe. Not cool shoe people not cool at all.

"

First of all, these shoes feel really small, even if you order a size up. They feel really tight around your feet. They are made for little leprechaun feet. Second of all, the tongue is a cheap material that causes a loud squeaking noise when it rubs against the rest of the shoe. This is something I've noticed a lot lately with certain Adidas and Puma sneakers. Companies are cutting corners and giving you low-quality sneakers that loudly squeak when you wear them. Take my advice and don't buy these shoes.

These shoes have been a nightmare.  First off, its confusing because the box will have a US size but the shoe will have a UK size so it looks like youre getting the wrong size.  My boyfriend swears by them so I thought I’d get them to when they were on sale here.  They run very small.  My normal size is 10.5 but the 10.5 were way too tight.

I bought these as a gift, and the recipient loved them. They're a great looking shoe with the vintage styling of older designs. The shoe is very flat, not any arch to speak of, and the sole is pretty hard with a very thin insole. I saw a lot of reviews stating that the shoe size was not the size ordered or the size written on the box, and I think I know why...there is a sticker on the insole that displays the European size, which is one size less than American sizing, example: you order a shoe in 9.5 US, and the big gold sticker says 8.5 (it also specifies that it's the European size in smaller print)... don't worry about that sticker because there's also a label on the tongue which states the size in US, EU, and something else that I don't remember. Some people may have gotten the wrong size shoe, but most probably just saw that sticker and didn't realize that it was the EU size and their shoe was actually the right size. That sole may also need to be trimmed to fit the shoe better. Just know what you're getting, don't expect the best quality ever from a $50 shoe, realize that this shoe is more for looks and probably not the best thing to wear all day long, and you'll probably enjoy the shoe for what it is...a great looking shoe

"

The size was incorrect. There was no size chart when you’re ordering these shoes. It’s all in US sizing. We go by the UK sizing a there was no indication to that. The women’s US size chart varies to the US men’s sizing chart! It’s ridiculous and frustrating and it should clearly state the UK to US and EUR sizing chart.

Bought this for driving a manual transmission car at autocross events (not soccer/football). Purchased the puma liga and the adidas samba for comparison.Size - went up 1/2 in both shoes from my normal. Puma fits perfectly but adidas is slightly big.Quality - adidas samba is 20% higher quality than the puma liga, it’s just beefier construction all around (which is actually bad for what I want as a driving shoe). Notice the shot of the insoles and you can see that puma has a lighter weight and thunder construction. The sole of the puma liga is noticeably more flexible than the adidas samba. Push them against each other and the puma fold while the adidas barely moves.Design - I prefer the look of the puma. And I very much prefer the heel cup of the puma, which has a tacky leather that holds well as compared to the adidas which is fabric and resulted in my heel slipping as I walked. The tongue of the adidas samba is also huge - I know it’s for soccer, but dang.I’ll be keeping the puma ligas in 1/2 size up from normal. Quality is good for the price and they just feel better.

I really like the look and vibe of these shoes. Note that they are super loud and squeeky. This is from the tongue rubbing against the inside. I solved it by lightly sanding the inside where the tongue meets the shoe. Easy fix, but it was really annoyingly loud before this. Now nice and quiet.  So I hated them a few days ago and now like them again. I'll see if it stays that way. May have been my socks, but on a hot day recently they did feel a bit stuffy and warm, jury still out on ventilation... but maybe take note for those with sweaty feet.

Shoes seems to be good quality.  This is supped to be US size 8.5 but box states US 8.5 but inside was UK 8.5 or US 9.5. It is too long and wide.For most part US 8.5 is 42 Europe. So I re-ordered 9, which is 42 Europe according to the sizing chart.Hoping it will fit.

The shoe looks great, wished it would have fit great, I wear a 12 normal, and these were just way too narrow. They also lacked support, which I would have ignored if the width would have been acceptable. Sadly, I had to return these, and there is no larger half size available.

I love the way they look! Unfortunately, the rigid leather tongue jabbed into the top of my foot with every step. I tried them on with no-show socks first and that was a no. With thick athletic socks they don't cut into my ankle, but I just don't like long socks. I will have to return.

I bought a pair of these new and the sole split and delaminated at the front after about 4 weeks. Obviously, Puma changed the composition of the sole because once I had a pair of Ligas that lasted for about 4 years. I’ll never buy another Puma product.

Absolutely love the shoes!!! However I order a US 6.5 since I’m a Euro 37 and they were wayyyy to large and the euro said 38.5 on the tag.

Really poor update compared to the classic suede Liga that Puma used to make. The uppers are no longer suede, the sides are no longer padded, and the wide toe box is now narrow.  The old ones looked better, were way more comfortable and didn't need any breaking in. These feel and look cheap, not the same shoe at all as the old Ligas. A big downgrade. I hope they bring the old, all suede, better built Ligas back.

I bought these shoes on Monday and received them on Tuesday and was charged $59.83 but I ordered another pair today because my husband plays pickleball and racquetball and loved these shoes.

These are amongst my favorite shoes. They work well for driving, but the gum sole is also suitable for walking and running. They are moderately padded, but you can't use heavily padded shoes for driving, for instance. Also, I love the classic, timeless styling. The fit is good; a sticker on the bottom of the shoe says 9, but they are 10 in US size. (9 must be the UK size...) I generally wear 10-sized shoes with thick socks and 9.5 with no socks or thin socks. The ten size fits me perfectly.

Second pair of adidas this style.  My first pair were approximately 7 years old, got lots of use from them.  They developed cracked in the sole from the rubber drying out, no big deal.These look good, ok for street use.  I wouldn’t wear these for jogging or a strenuous workout.  Width, as mentioned over and over in the reviews is narrow.  If you’re between sizes, size up.

Originally a fan of the OG Adidas Sambas, but these Pumas do just fine for my needs. They look amazing and handle well for breakdancing and skating. Nice overall pair of shoes for everyday usage, and I would recommend them to anyone. Definitely worth it, especially for under 40 dollars.

If there's ever an arbitrage scenario on Amazon, this is it. The men's version of these shoes are $30 more expensive and they are EXACTLY the same shoe. I love them and am glad I was able to get for a discount because I stumbled on the ""women's"" version.

I ordered a 10 and the shoe in the box said 9. It was small. I returned it thinking they sent me the wrong size. I re-ordered and the same thing happened. Pretty sure the size in the shoe is UK size. Still runs small. Need to re-order again a half size bigger.

Bought these at another store- but i wear a 12 and they fit. People reported tight fit; and very true as they narrow (5th toe) and need some breaking in time ; but the area, where the ball of your foot lies to outer side (medial to lateral) is wide and has a toe that tapers at 20-25 degrees to foot apex. They do fit differently vs other puma shoe standards and have a slight creaking plasticity sound to them new (Not suede like regular pumas. More like a synthetic leather) so minus -1 star. It will get quiet w wear and comfort; as this my 2nd pair. If they rub where your pinky (5th) toe is u need to size 1/2 up (taper of shoe) but this is just a suggestion.Tongue is very low in these- fyi.For under $50 they give an alternative retro style.Quality noted from textiles made in thailand imo.

I’m a BIG fan of Adidas Trainers, but I also remember a pair of Puma Romas lasting me four or five years, so I decided to give these Super Liga’s a go.  This was a great decision.

Un calzado bueno y a buen precio, dice que es piel. Pero no creo que sea una piel de buena calidad, me gusta más la piel de los adidas samba, y el logo de puma negro ese al parecer no es de piel. Si se ve vinipiel muy económica, me quedo bien, no aprieta ni es grande, pero es un sneaker bastante duro por dentro y la. Suela es pura goma, la lengüeta es bastante corta lo cual llega a lastimar la piel con el rose de la lengüeta con el pie, en lo personal me agrada más el adidas samba ya que es un poco más cómodo, en nivel interior y se ve mejor calidad en la piel!

I have always been an Adidas Samba guy.  From wearing them around town to playing indoor soccer.  I'd wear and completely abuse the *&^% out of them and they'd last.  Boy, would they last.  As of late, it is impossible to find size 10 REAL Adidas Samba OG in Canada (Adidas you suck!).  I have always known about these sweet looking Puma Super Ligas.After reading reviews and, frankly, being petrified of ordering them due to sizing and overall quality concerns, I bit the bullet and bought them.  If anything was wrong with them, I could return them and they were $80 Canadian taxes in.They came yesterday.  I have to say, the material seems to be leather on the upper.  At least parts of it, so that was one sigh of relief.  It actually has the leather sticker stuck on the insole for what that's worth.  And it kind of smells like leather.  Sigh of relief two, they fit like a dream after ordering HALF A SIZE UP - that is key.  I'm a ten in Sambas and pretty much all shoes with very wide, hideous feet and these babies in a 10.5 fit like a dream.  The Sambas tend to be tight on me for the first month until the REAL leather stretches to perfection around my Hobbit-like feet.Now for what I expected and a negative.  The soles oh the soles....they are thin.  I guess because so many reviews mentioned how thin they were, I feel like I have to gingerly walk on them and not drag my feet with fear of any tread being removed and me Fred Flintstone walking on skin.  So would I wear these for their initial intention back when Madonna was creating new hits (indoor soccer), absolutely not.  They will be worn daily for work and walking about, but nothing too rigorous.We will see how they hold up in the year(s) to come.  I'm still nervous.  I usually get 3 years out my Sambas.

I've never bought sneakers off of the internet before; and now I know why. I wear a 10.1/2 and so that is what I ordered. They are way too tight on me! I decided I would wear them for an hour every day and maybe stretch them out, as I hate to go through the return routine. However, I don't know if it is due to stretching them out, but now I feel as if my little toe is hanging over the end of the innersole! They are nice sneakers, and nice looking, but be wary of the size I would recommend buying a larger size than you would usually wear!

Reasonably priced for this pair, it gives my husband good support being a musician, he stands on his feet for 2+ hrs at a time. He gives this a 10/10, it’s true to size. If you want more comfort and toe space you can go up half size. He wears 9.5 and I bought his the 10. It fits perfectly with thick enough socks.

 Great shoe but I wish I knew to get a full size larger. Very good quality, good comfort but just a tad too small I wear a size 11 1/2 so I got my size in hopes of the shoe fitting true to size. (Not!) that’s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The colors (Red & Black) are rich and vibrant. The shoe is well made with the above exception. I really like them though.

I had tried these on in a store but, wanted to check others first. When I went to buy these in store they were sold out. Found on Amazon and they are legit not knock offs. Same fit and comfort. Haven't used as workout shoes just daily wear. Just have to wait on longevity to know full ""bang for the buck"".

As the title says, I would easily give these 5 stars if they weren't being marketed as a running shoe. They're some of the lightest and most breathable shoes I've ever worn. They have fair durability for everyday wear, lasting a year before beginning to wear down at the pads. They're beautiful and the outside of the shoes still looks almost as good as the day I bought them.My only complaint is that they're actually quite bad for running and positively dreadful for hiking. Not only do they lack any support in the arches, they lack support in their *soles*. If you walk outdoors across any sort of jagged rocks, you'll feel every edge of the rocks on the soles of your feet. If you run in these, you'll feel every slap of your feet on the pavement. There's just not enough rigidity and/or thickness to the bottoms of these shoes for any hard activities.Absolutely great for casual wear though!

There is no doubt that European shoes are made with quality and comfort of their clients. My son loved his Puma. He was very impressed how comfortable the shoes are.The best purchase so far

 These shoes are lightweight & easy to wash. I put in a Dr. Scholls insert since the memory foam that Puma provides is thin & non-supportive. I recommend this shoe to anyone with very flat feet & people with a low arch. I purchased this for my son he has toe Gait walking which means he walks on his tip toes due to his calf muscle tendons being so tight with tension he can’t put his feet flat on the floor. He is going in for surgery here next week so I hope he can enjoy wearing shoes. Thank You Puma!

These turned out better than expected. Got them for my husband, he wears a size 13 shoe and usually finds that most of his shoes are a bit narrow and uncomfortable.

Big fan of the design, looks better irl. Really like the effort and the ingenuity of it in hiding the foam. Very competitively priced as well. It's a perfect fit and although I'm yet to put it through the paces, it's very supportive and the foam has a bounce that helps. Feels more like a gel. Always wanted a Puma cause of Milan.

I had great expectations with this shoes. I expected them to fit snuggle but they don’t have any support at all, I’ve been using them for cross fit and your foot will be all around the place, the shoe doesn’t bring any structure at all. The sole is soft, but yet again the arch doesn’t have any support at all, and worse yet you can’t replace it as it is glued to the shoe. If I knew I would not had bought them  at all.They look great though!

This shoe has support pads in them. I had double knee replacement July 8, 2020. Suffer from rheumatoid arthritis & OA in both knees & hips @ only 48 yrs old. I stand on my feet 8-10 as a registered nurse. So support is very very necessary to me. The comfort, fit is extremely important to me & it far exceeds my expectations.  As u would expect with my joint problems having a light weight shoe is extremely important.  So with all that said the price & the sharp appearance of the shoe please don't pass it up!!!

I have many Puma sneakers and never returned any of them.  From this selection I have ordered 3 pairs, consecutively, so far and returned 2 of them.  2 white and the last one black.  First pair had a dent on the tip of the show and was very visible, returned.  Second pair fit pretty good but the heals weren't on the same level.  Returned both of them and ordered the black pair, returned. The black pair was actually size 111/2 even though on the label is written size 12. It's hurting my big toe after wearing only for 2 hours.They look good, hence 2 stars, but IMO are poorly made.  Returning the last pair.

Last year I purchased the all red version of this shoe and ordered it as an 11 in size. I felt that was too small so I ordered an 11.5 this time and to my surprise they fit tighter then the red ones?

Imagine running on flat rocks loosely tied to your feet, and you’ll only begin to understand the torture these shoes inflicted on my feet and body the first time I tried running in them.We’ve all had those running shoes that took a few runs to break in. Trust me…these aren’t those shoes. After four of five runs — hey, I believe in redemption! — I’ve completely given up on these puppies.Of course I considered returning them, but I didn’t deem these shoes worthy of the carbon emissions required to transport them back to whichever poor warehouse they would land. (And ok, yes, I missed the return window because sometimes I’m not very organized.)Normally, I’d donate them to Goodwill. But I cannot bear the thought of burdening another soul with the discomfort wrought by these mini foot-torture machines.But hey: maybe it’s just me. A lot of positive reviews here which is one reason I purchased.Consider yourself warned…

I got these as the reviews were mostly good and I loved the color combination. However, it's been exactly one year and the fabric where the big toe meets the shoe has worn out, there is a hole there now. My last two pairs of sneakers lasted me YEARS. Now one year later I have to buy another pair. Also the mesh on top of the shoe, if you walk on wet grass, your socks will be soaked with water and gross. So they are very comfortable and look great but what's the use in that if they don't last, sorely disappointed. First and last time I buy PUMA footwear.

My Nike's that I wear everyday to work for the past 2 years don't have any holes in them. Very disappointed in the quality of the Puma's.

The shoes seem great until you walk any distance in them. I’ve gotten blisters on both feet after about 1 mile, 3 times now. I changed out the insoles to some good, well known ones. The insoles I took out were basically a quarter inch foam pad.. so when I replaced it with the new ones there was no padding what so ever remaining in the shoe. The toe ends have no protection from the elements. Basically like a thin sock. 1 small puddle and your feet are soaked. I usually buy 1 pair of shoes a year.. this year I had to buy 2.. My wife hated the pair she got too for the same reasons. Even at half the current price I could never recommend these to someone

Get a size bigger than you usually wear. They have a lot of soft foam around the heel but not enough on the bottom near the toes. It makes walking on concrete uncomfortable and the fit is really tight. The width of the shoes is tight and they don't allow your feet to breath. Its a very hot shoe but they look cool.
"
9377,"
I had to get rid of my leather (pleather) pumas because they did not breath and had odor issues early on.  These ones are so good I went out and bought another pair.  The original pair seems new after wearing almost daily for a month.  The only con I can think of is that they are are a little heavy due to the solid construction.

Love these and get a ton of compliments as these shoes look different with the laces going down to the bottom of the shoe.  The grey and blue look great and just a unique shoe.The actual bottom of the shoe seems thin and responsive for working out, but the insole is highly cushioned an comfortable.  I wear them to walk, usually 3-5 miles and I also wear them out and about.  Comfy, casual, and cool.  Will end with that alliteration.

I've never bought sneakers off of the internet before; and now I know why. I wear a 10.1/2 and so that is what I ordered. They are way too tight on me! I decided I would wear them for an hour every day and maybe stretch them out, as I hate to go through the return routine. However, I don't know if it is due to stretching them out, but now I feel as if my little toe is hanging over the end of the innersole! They are nice sneakers, and nice looking, but be wary of the size I would recommend buying a larger size than you would usually wear!

Puma is known for its sleek and neat designs, has always been a reliable shoes of good quality and comfort, this is shoe is nothing short of that.The sole of this shoe, however it’s like nothing my husband has ever felt, lol n his words, like walking on clouds, this foam support on this sole is truly remarkable. Reasonably priced for this pair, it gives my husband good support being a musician, he stands on his feet for 2+ hrs at a time. He gives this a 10/10, it’s true to size. If you want more comfort and toe space you can go up half size. He wears 9.5 and I bought his the 10. It fits perfectly with thick enough socks.

 Great shoe but I wish I knew to get a full size larger. Very good quality, good comfort but just a tad too small I wear a size 11 1/2 so I got my size in hopes of the shoe fitting true to size. (Not!) that’s why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The colors (Red & Black) are rich and vibrant. The shoe is well made with the above exception. I really like them though.

I had tried these on in a store but, wanted to check others first. When I went to buy these in store they were sold out. Found on Amazon and they are legit not knock offs. Same fit and comfort. Haven't used as workout shoes just daily wear. Just have to wait on longevity to know full ""bang for the buck"".
"

As the title says, I would easily give these 5 stars if they weren't being marketed as a running shoe. They're some of the lightest and most breathable shoes I've ever worn. They have fair durability for everyday wear, lasting a year before beginning to wear down at the pads. They're beautiful and the outside of the shoes still looks almost as good as the day I bought them.My only complaint is that they're actually quite bad for running and positively dreadful for hiking. Not only do they lack any support in the arches, they lack support in their *soles*. If you walk outdoors across any sort of jagged rocks, you'll feel every edge of the rocks on the soles of your feet. If you run in these, you'll feel every slap of your feet on the pavement. There's just not enough rigidity and/or thickness to the bottoms of these shoes for any hard activities.Absolutely great for casual wear though!

 These shoes are lightweight & easy to wash. I put in a Dr. Scholls insert since the memory foam that Puma provides is thin & non-supportive. I recommend this shoe to anyone with very flat feet & people with a low arch. I purchased this for my son he has toe Gait walking which means he walks on his tip toes due to his calf muscle tendons being so tight with tension he can’t put his feet flat on the floor. He is going in for surgery here next week so I hope he can enjoy wearing shoes. Thank You Puma!

Big fan of the design, looks better irl. Really like the effort and the ingenuity of it in hiding the foam. Very competitively priced as well.

I had great expectations with this shoes. I expected them to fit snuggle but they don’t have any support at all, I’ve been using them for cross fit and your foot will be all around the place, the shoe doesn’t bring any structure at all. The sole is soft, but yet again the arch doesn’t have any support at all, and worse yet you can’t replace it as it is glued to the shoe. If I knew I would not had bought them  at all.They look great though!

This shoe has support pads in them. I had double knee replacement July 8, 2020. Suffer from rheumatoid arthritis & OA in both knees & hips @ only 48 yrs old. I stand on my feet 8-10 as a registered nurse. So support is very very necessary to me. The comfort, fit is extremely important to me & it far exceeds my expectations.  As u would expect with my joint problems having a light weight shoe is extremely important.  So with all that said the price & the sharp appearance of the shoe please don't pass it up!!!

I have many Puma sneakers and never returned any of them.  From this selection I have ordered 3 pairs, consecutively, so far and returned 2 of them.  2 white and the last one black.  First pair had a dent on the tip of the show and was very visible, returned.  Second pair fit pretty good but the heals weren't on the same level.  Returned both of them and ordered the black pair, returned. The black pair was actually size 111/2 even though on the label is written size 12. It's hurting my big toe after wearing only for 2 hours.They look good, hence 2 stars, but IMO are poorly made.  Returning the last pair.

I don't have a bad word to say about these shoes , very comfortable, good heel support and they have cushion in the shoes, very stylish on top off that , I brought them for myself and my daughter saw them and just had to have a pair also, her birthday was coming up so I bought them for her also thank you Amazon.

For my work I stand over 8 hours a day and for the first time my back or my knees was not hurting after wearing these shoes. You're actually getting a hell of a bargain for the pair of shoes. You get name brand shoes for less than Walmart prices. With a comfort that a lot of shoe companies can't even match.

Last year I purchased the all red version of this shoe and ordered it as an 11 in size. I felt that was too small so I ordered an 11.5 this time and to my surprise they fit tighter then the red ones? So unless my feet have grown an inch in the last year from an 11 to a twelve there is a problem with size consistency, I am thinking of returning these as well but they look so darn good! Would I buy again? YES! just in a larger size.

Bought these in June and I have to throw them away. I wear them at work 5 days a week. The fabric on both shoes where my big toe is has worn away. Both the outsides just below my pinkie toes has also worn away. 4 of the blue lace holders broke within the 1st few months on both, had to reconfigure the laces to make it work. Doesn't last.

Could me a little more cushiony.They run a bit narrow, and slightly small.Like the look, but went with a pair of Nike Air for around the same cost that were more comfortable.I'd probably have kept these if they fit a little better, really like the look.

Imagine running on flat rocks loosely tied to your feet, and you’ll only begin to understand the torture these shoes inflicted on my feet and body the first time I tried running in them.We’ve all had those running shoes that took a few runs to break in. Trust me…these aren’t those shoes. After four of five runs — hey, I believe in redemption! — I’ve completely given up on these puppies.Of course I considered returning them, but I didn’t deem these shoes worthy of the carbon emissions required to transport them back to whichever poor warehouse they would land. (And ok, yes, I missed the return window because sometimes I’m not very organized.)Normally, I’d donate them to Goodwill. But I cannot bear the thought of burdening another soul with the discomfort wrought by these mini foot-torture machines.But hey: maybe it’s just me. A lot of positive reviews here which is one reason I purchased.Consider yourself warned…

I got these as the reviews were mostly good and I loved the color combination. However, it's been exactly one year and the fabric where the big toe meets the shoe has worn out, there is a hole there now. My last two pairs of sneakers lasted me YEARS. Now one year later I have to buy another pair. Also the mesh on top of the shoe, if you walk on wet grass, your socks will be soaked with water and gross. So they are very comfortable and look great but what's the use in that if they don't last, sorely disappointed. First and last time I buy PUMA footwear.

The shoes seem great until you walk any distance in them. I’ve gotten blisters on both feet after about 1 mile, 3 times now. I changed out the insoles to some good, well known ones. The insoles I took out were basically a quarter inch foam pad.. so when I replaced it with the new ones there was no padding what so ever remaining in the shoe. The toe ends have no protection from the elements. Basically like a thin sock. 1 small puddle and your feet are soaked. I usually buy 1 pair of shoes a year.. this year I had to buy 2.. My wife hated the pair she got too for the same reasons. Even at half the current price I could never recommend these to someone

Get a size bigger than you usually wear. They have a lot of soft foam around the heel but not enough on the bottom near the toes. It makes walking on concrete uncomfortable and the fit is really tight. The width of the shoes is tight and they don't allow your feet to breath. Its a very hot shoe but they look cool.

I had to get rid of my leather (pleather) pumas because they did not breath and had odor issues early on.  These ones are so good I went out and bought another pair.  The original pair seems new after wearing almost daily for a month.  The only con I can think of is that they are are a little heavy due to the solid construction.

Product arrived quickly. They feel like you walking on memory foam clouds. haha. I thought they would be narrow. Glad they weren't. Fit great for wide foot people. Little problem is that they feel somewhat heavy. I'm use to wearing the Mens Skechers GOrun 600 but they no longer make them. Wanted something similar in weight and in black. Saw these Pumas and gave it a try. Happy with purchase.

Gel soles  Here’s the thing I do not like about the shoe, the gel that is in the insole. The gel tends to gather n on location making it uncomfortable to wear. This wear in the shoe happens in a short time frame and could use some modifications.

I love this style of shoes, I've only been wearing this for a few days and it's my 3rd.  what do I buy.I have seen bad opinions and as I want I buy it.  They fit well on my feet and last long enough for what I use them for.In some 10 days I will buy another one with a different design.I will continue to use this style, especially how comfortable it is.As for the price, of course I would like it to cost less.

At the end of the toe it gets tight. Nike wide is way better.
"

I bought this shoe along with the white version. First of all, the fit is great! I ordered the wide fit, and the shoe is very comfortable. However, after walking for the first time, I noticed that there's a lot of noise coming from the shoe. Not squeaks, per se, but rubbing where the materials for the tongue of the shoe rub against the material of the inner walls/sides of the shoe. It's not so bad when I wear these shoes casually with the laces untied and tucked inside, but when I tie the laces for a workout, the rubbing noise is very noticeable.This doesn't happen with the white version of this shoe, so I'm assuming it has to do with the matte/satin-finished material they use for the black version. If you're planning on using these to work out in a loud gym, it won't be a problem, but if you're planning to wear these casually, just know that the noise will eventually get to you.

I’m very satisfied with the aforementioned shoes. I’m glad that I was able to purchase a wide with shoe size from Amazon because I never saw wide width shoes on the actual company’s website. I use the shoes for my daily walking routine and they are very comfortable. I used to go walking wearing a pair of sketchers shoes which are terrible for long walks. They feel like walking flat on concrete. This pair of puma shoes are great for walking, very comfortable and well worth the purchase. I can tell the difference right away and my only regret is that I didn’t purchase 2 pairs.

Great style ordered men’s bc they didn’t have any pink and black in women’s sizes which was very dissapointing.  I bought these for work they run a bit big but with thicker socks they work ok. Being in my feet at work after five hrs plus every day not the best for comfort had to use shoe inserts which helped a little but over all not much comfort. Would not recommend using if you are in your feet all day better for style than comfort. Noticed when I walk they make a fake leather like squeak if you will. Overall good look great price! I work at a grocery store store in the mean and seafood Dept unfortunately as I have to wash down the floors each night with harsh chemicals I noticed only after 4 months of wearing my sneakers did start to flake off and got ruined. They were nice at first. Got great compliments as they are not def slip resistant which I’m supposed to be wearing. I did order a pair of slip resistant shoes from here that will be arriving tomorrow night. Again great looking sneaker just don’t wear them to work if your on your feet all day and def not slip resistant or water proof. Comfy sneaker too!

I am a puma's fun for year, this time I am pretty disappointed. Quality, only wide versions, no big numbers M-13, M-14. I had to buy inserts to add confort and can't wear them to work nor the GYM because they are to loose. My feet are long and narrow and only PUMA'Sand CONVERS were my Wright fit.
"
9780,"
LOVE the style of these shoes and, as regular Puma shoes tend to run narrow, I was worried that the ""wide"" shoes would also be narrow. That's definitely not the case. They are, without a doubt, ""WIDE"". There's also a fair amount of room for large (circumference) feet, surprisingly.My one and only gripe with these shoes is that the insert in the bottom of the shoe is literally a flat piece of foam and underneath that is a flat inside-sole. I have flat feet (my Chiropractor described my feet as ""as flat as a brick"" yet even my pathetic arches felt unsupported by these shoes. Thankfully, I have custom inserts (they scanned my feet to determine exactly what I needed and they cost $150 per pair and they're so amazing I bought two pair - one for casual shoes and one for work shoes) that I swapped in for the standard insert and all is right with the world.So, if you like the style, and you don't mind a shoe which offers little-if-any arch support, and you have a wide foot, order 'em!-1 star for the lack of arch supportUPDATE: One thing I didn't notice immediately is how not-ventilated these shoes are. My feet get SO hot and sweaty which is not normally something I deal with.

I love these sneakers! As an athlete with wide feet who loves to train a variety of modalities, I have trouble finding shoes that are light and  fit well. I've continued to buy these shoes time and time again after I've worn them out because they have served me so well. The foam inner sole is super comfortable and the cushion adds support for my relatively low arch. You can run, lift weights, perform plyometrics...just about anything in these shoes. At the price point, these are truly heaven sent.

The description ""Running Shoe"" should be taken out.  I don't think Puma has ever made a modern day running shoe.  If you know any thing about running shoes you could tell right away by just the picture.  All the revues that state not a running shoe, no arch, no cushioning, etc.  No Duh!This is a nice shoe. Purely a lifestyle shoe and you can get away with using them in the weight room too.  I purchased for that reason.  Hard to find Puma in wide.  This model ran big.  I'm a consistent 9.5 EE, XW, in every athletic shoe except for Brooks.  I'm a 4E with them.I ordered the 9.5 W and I had to re-order for 1 full size smaller.  It fits great and there is no arch supports and not very cushioned.  So no long distance or short distance running.Their All Turf cleats were the best.

They're nice shoes, they look good, they fit well, are supportive and light weight.  The only thing is if you live in a cooler climate or have cold feet, these shoes are not warm at all.

My shorter, wider feet (8E) are hard to fit so it's always nice to find a pair that do. It's been awhile since I've worn full-on leather kicks and these are stiff but that's not unexpected. The rise is a little high; I'll probably get some inserts just to bring my foot up a little. I shouldn't call them sneakers, they squeak quite a bit when I step. I don't consider that a knock, but I hope it relaxes after they are broken in.

Arch support. Like someone has their hand under your feet , the width of the shoe is great , sometime I can't wear all name brand shoe .

Size is true to it's number but the inside of the shoe has a plastic sole liner that's thin that covers the memory foam from being damaged.

I've always worn an 8.5 Wide, but in the past x number of years, finding them has become harder and harder.  Finding Wide in Nike is next to impossible.  The only reliable Wide shoe I'm finding available any more is the Puma, and I greatly appreciate them for continuing to make a good shoe instead of forcing me to stuff my feet into a shoe that's a half size too large just so I don't have a toe removed to fit.

The look and fit of the shoe are good. But the soul of the shoe has no arch support and the inside heal breaks down quickly. After only 3 weeks there was a hole in the inside heal lining.

Heavy shoes, not fit for running in. They make ya stand out too much, better chance of getting mugged. After wearing them a few days I got athletes foot, was not at all amused by that. Should be sprayed before they got shipped.

Not bad for the money but does need some quality control. Right shoe is a little off. Also could not get black in Wide so settled for white. But hope these do not come apart like my New Balance did. Got these because they are not cloth.

They look good and have style. Decent comfort. I gave four stars as I feel the middle of section does get narrower than it should. Doesn't effect comfort to much. Think they are great for a night out etc. Not built for running or long hours on your feet at work. But definitely at $40ish that I spent they are worth that.

I've owned these before...bought again cuz they look pretty fresh (yeh, like early b-boy fresh) and cuz you can get them in wide width. That said, they are not leather and they dont breathe well so they are hard to wear in the heat of the summer. Also, i notice that they get dirty much faster than my prior pair. No very hard to get/keep clean.

Got the wide version in black and a white pair regular width. They feel the same on my feet, tight. And that’s not the worst part. I was disappointed in that although the material is synthetic not leather they feel like plastic. And they sound like plastic when you walk in them. Very noisy shoes just from flexing your foot as you walk. It’s not the soles that squeak it’s the synthetic material they are made from. I walked on carpet and you could hear me coming a mile away. Very distracting and annoying. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money on better quality you’ll thank yourself trust me.

These fit my size 13 feet just fine, and were supportive. BUT, these was no loop in the tongues, so the tongues slipped forward into the toe box after only a few steps. I walk an average of 13000 steps a day, so this was a big deal. In addition, they started wearing out, with holes in the uppers. I will not buy Puma's again (if this is what they were).

I LOVE Pumas, but the down side is, they don't have that much of a wide foot selection. The TAZON is the ONLY shoe I can find that comes in ""hobbit foot"" sizes. For this shoe, the design is bada$$ and the price was just perfect! They came in with no issues. Would buy from these folks again!
"
9932,"
This color/style has a rubberized outer shell which is fine on most of the shoe, but they used the same material for the tongue so it squeaks relentlessly against the inside of the shoe when you walk around, which does not get less annoying over time. It also causes the tongue to shift out of position to the side more often than other Tazon designs, which is not comfortable. Also, the right heel started to separate from the sole in the first two weeks.Other Tazon variants are good in general, but not this one.
"
9933,"
It's a good shoe just not as much comfort as my other pair. The insole is not as comfortable as some of their other shoes.

I bought these shoes because I needed something to go with business casual but still be able to basketball with my students. These shoes look great and would be very comfortable but they seem too narrow even though they are wide. This is the 2nd pair of wide Pumas that I have purchased and both were tight. I decided to give these a chance to see if they would break in. They did somewhat but still feel tight. I can live with them until I can afford another pair of shoes.

I have a very wide foot foe my size and it is very difficult to fine a wide shoe that fits and looks good. This shoe is deceptively wide and looks great!

I've had these shoes for nearly a year, and they are honestly the most comfortable pair I've ever owned. Even after all of that time, the soles have maintained their plushness well.

The shoes feel like pleather cardboard.  Very thin walled.  The foam inserts feel cheap and collapses easily straight to the sole providing no kind of support.  I had to double take at the brand to make sure the brand didn't say something like Fuma as they literally feel generic.  They are supposed to be cross trainers, but I find it unlikely they will last even as walking shoes.

I love these shoes.  I purchased them based on an orthopedic article I read about shoes that were good for Achilles tendon issues.  The heel is raised just enough to take tension off of the Achilles, and wide enough that I can wear a brace and not have my motion impeded.  I also like the foam on the inside of the shoe.  Plus, they just look good.  I bought a second pair in black I liked them so much.  ​

I bought these shoes for my teenage son. He's only worn them for 2 months and like some of the other reviews showed, the sole is already pealing off the bottom and the material around it flaking off. One side pealing off all the way back to mid-sole. I've bought many Puma shoes and love them, but these are just trash. I've literally had to buy Gorilla glue to try to salvage these things, but looks like I'll be in the market for another pair of shoes soon. The quality is something that I would expect from a $20 no name brand shoe, not Puma. Highly disappointed.

I purchased this shoe as a replacement for the regular width version. The wide fit my “box foot” comfortably. Only reason for <5 stars is that the insole wears out quickly. It’s been a few months, and the insoles have already deteriorated beyond a comfortable level of daily activity.

Puma shoes seem to run so far out of the range of US standards that is so hard to shop for a shoe online. With stores closed this is sometimes the only way to shop for shoes. I like the brand but it's just hard to find a wide shoe that fits properly.

I like to run trails and along the beach. The holes on the top let sand in which is fine if you can dump it out after a run. But the liner keeps the sand from getting into the shoe so you can't dump it out between uses. Pretty soon my shoes are heavy and getting tighter! I had to cut the liner out to let the sand out. POOR DESIGN.

I had to throw these sneakers away after wearing them for several months because the heal cloth was rubbing off and then my ankle was chaffing from the inside of the shoe. It was starting to be painful to wear them even with socks on. The bottom portion of the front started falling off a little while after that. As I walked outside on the streets, the shoes would occasionally collect elements from the ground.These sneakers were nice and fairly comfortable at first. I would not order these again personally.

I would give these zero stars if I could.  The plastic uppers are so thin and weak that they offer no support at all.  Also, when you walk in them, they make a loud sound that sounds like an elephant rubbing its thighs together as it walks.  Wear these to the zoo and compare.  These are terrible shoes.

These shoes did not last very long.  It was a great set of shoes but the leather is poor quality and the activity of tying them caused an eyelet to fail.  I rated them for comfort while they lasted.

Probably the worst shoe that I remember owning. No matter how tight you tie the laces, the tongue still slides off to one side. The bottoms are so flat, they almost force you to run flat footed.

I wear a 15 M in shoes. I like to try out different  sneakers in 14 wide because I typically don't like the way my foot looks in a size 15 shoe. The aesthetics of the sneakers are quite pleasing. They have a nice slim look and feel. They run slightly tight with socks--my toe tags the tip of the shoe a bit. However, I'm wearing a size down so I consider these true to fit. I would try a bigger size before switching to a different shoe because I like the style so much.

In the description of the shoe it says Women's. That is not correct. These are men's.

Product arrived quickly. They feel like you walking on memory foam clouds. haha. I thought they would be narrow. Glad they weren't. Fit great for wide foot people. Little problem is that they feel somewhat heavy. I'm use to wearing the Mens Skechers GOrun 600 but they no longer make them. Wanted something similar in weight and in black.

Gel soles  Here’s the thing I do not like about the shoe, the gel that is in the insole. The gel tends to gather n on location making it uncomfortable to wear. This wear in the shoe happens in a short time frame and could use some modifications.

I love this style of shoes, I've only been wearing this for a few days and it's my 3rd.  what do I buy.I have seen bad opinions and as I want I buy it.

"

I bought this shoe along with the white version. First of all, the fit is great! I ordered the wide fit, and the shoe is very comfortable. However, after walking for the first time, I noticed that there's a lot of noise coming from the shoe. Not squeaks, per se, but rubbing where the materials for the tongue of the shoe rub against the material of the inner walls/sides of the shoe. It's not so bad when I wear these shoes casually with the laces untied and tucked inside, but when I tie the laces for a workout, the rubbing noise is very noticeable.This doesn't happen with the white version of this shoe, so I'm assuming it has to do with the matte/satin-finished material they use for the black version. If you're planning on using these to work out in a loud gym, it won't be a problem, but if you're planning to wear these casually, just know that the noise will eventually get to you.

I’m very satisfied with the aforementioned shoes. I’m glad that I was able to purchase a wide with shoe size from Amazon because I never saw wide width shoes on the actual company’s website. I use the shoes for my daily walking routine and they are very comfortable. I used to go walking wearing a pair of sketchers shoes which are terrible for long walks. They feel like walking flat on concrete. This pair of puma shoes are great for walking, very comfortable and well worth the purchase. I can tell the difference right away and my only regret is that I didn’t purchase 2 pairs.

"

Great style ordered men’s bc they didn’t have any pink and black in women’s sizes which was very dissapointing.  I bought these for work they run a bit big but with thicker socks they work ok. Being in my feet at work after five hrs plus every day not the best for comfort had to use shoe inserts which helped a little but over all not much comfort. Would not recommend using if you are in your feet all day better for style than comfort. Noticed when I walk they make a fake leather like squeak if you will. Overall good look great price! I work at a grocery store store in the mean and seafood Dept unfortunately as I have to wash down the floors each night with harsh chemicals I noticed only after 4 months of wearing my sneakers did start to flake off and got ruined. They were nice at first. Got great compliments as they are not def slip resistant which I’m supposed to be wearing. I did order a pair of slip resistant shoes from here that will be arriving tomorrow night. Again great looking sneaker just don’t wear them to work if your on your feet all day and def not slip resistant or water proof. Comfy sneaker too!

I am a puma's fun for year, this time I am pretty disappointed. Quality, only wide versions, no big numbers M-13, M-14. I had to buy inserts to add confort and can't wear them to work nor the GYM because they are to loose. My feet are long and narrow and only PUMA'Sand CONVERS were my Wright fit.
"
10780,"
LOVE the style of these shoes and, as regular Puma shoes tend to run narrow, I was worried that the ""wide"" shoes would also be narrow. That's definitely not the case. They are, without a doubt, ""WIDE"". There's also a fair amount of room for large (circumference) feet, surprisingly.My one and only gripe with these shoes is that the insert in the bottom of the shoe is literally a flat piece of foam and underneath that is a flat inside-sole. I have flat feet (my Chiropractor described my feet as ""as flat as a brick"" yet even my pathetic arches felt unsupported by these shoes. Thankfully, I have custom inserts (they scanned my feet to determine exactly what I needed and they cost $150 per pair and they're so amazing I bought two pair - one for casual shoes and one for work shoes) that I swapped in for the standard insert and all is right with the world.So, if you like the style, and you don't mind a shoe which offers little-if-any arch support, and you have a wide foot, order 'em!-1 star for the lack of arch supportUPDATE: One thing I didn't notice immediately is how not-ventilated these shoes are. My feet get SO hot and sweaty which is not normally something I deal with.

I love these sneakers! As an athlete with wide feet who loves to train a variety of modalities, I have trouble finding shoes that are light and  fit well. I've continued to buy these shoes time and time again after I've worn them out because they have served me so well. The foam inner sole is super comfortable and the cushion adds support for my relatively low arch. You can run, lift weights, perform plyometrics...just about anything in these shoes. At the price point, these are truly heaven sent.

The description ""Running Shoe"" should be taken out.  I don't think Puma has ever made a modern day running shoe.  If you know any thing about running shoes you could tell right away by just the picture.  All the revues that state not a running shoe, no arch, no cushioning, etc.  No Duh!This is a nice shoe. Purely a lifestyle shoe and you can get away with using them in the weight room too.  I purchased for that reason.  Hard to find Puma in wide.  This model ran big.  I'm a consistent 9.5 EE, XW, in every athletic shoe except for Brooks.  I'm a 4E with them.I ordered the 9.5 W and I had to re-order for 1 full size smaller.  It fits great and there is no arch supports and not very cushioned.  So no long distance or short distance running.Their All Turf cleats were the best.

Love the style but the fit is a tad smaller than I'd like. I ordered the 10 wide and wish I'd ordered a 10.5. They still fit but I like a little wiggle room in the toe. If there were such a thing as a 10.25 they'd be perfect.Also, these shoes are really, really squeeky where the tongue and upper rub together when you walk. Hopefully that'll go away.

They're nice shoes, they look good, they fit well, are supportive and light weight.  The only thing is if you live in a cooler climate or have cold feet, these shoes are not warm at all.

My shorter, wider feet (8E) are hard to fit so it's always nice to find a pair that do. It's been awhile since I've worn full-on leather kicks and these are stiff but that's not unexpected. The rise is a little high; I'll probably get some inserts just to bring my foot up a little. I shouldn't call them sneakers, they squeak quite a bit when I step. I don't consider that a knock, but I hope it relaxes after they are broken in.

Arch support. Like someone has their hand under your feet , the width of the shoe is great , sometime I can't wear all name brand shoe . So I stay with what I like PUMA fits my foot . walking .running ,standing that are just a great shoe the way the feel around my toes it a very comfortable fit. And they look so cool no matter what you have on or maybe its nudt me that makes the shoe look good . Could be just me 😁😁

Toe box on this particular shoe is too small. I’ve had this style, just the one in all black at the same size/width, and it didn’t fit tight at the toe box.

If they don’t, I’ll have to return them!

I liked these at first but it did not take long to lose the arch support and they started to fall apart. I work from home and am not super active but after 1 year they are somehow destroyed.

I am kind of surprised given I really do not abuse these or treat them badly. Disappointed and will not purchase again.

"

Very comfortable ,I've been using them in the gym 3 to 4 times a week for a couple months now and they have held up to everything I've thrown at them. And they don't squeak when I walk like the Nike shoes I previously used which drove me nuts.
"

Shoes described as wide, but these are not wide. In fact they are uncomfortable and only wish I didn't wait to wear them until after the return date or I would definitely have returned.
"
10862,"
Size is true to it's number but the inside of the shoe has a plastic sole liner that's thin that covers the memory foam from being damaged. Problem is it will rip off within 3 months and the foam will start to wear out and rip out. For how exoensive these shoes are, they should have better construction.
"
10863,"
I've always worn an 8.5 Wide, but in the past x number of years, finding them has become harder and harder.  Finding Wide in Nike is next to impossible.  The only reliable Wide shoe I'm finding available any more is the Puma, and I greatly appreciate them for continuing to make a good shoe instead of forcing me to stuff my feet into a shoe that's a half size too large just so I don't have a toe removed to fit.
"
10864,"
My first pair of Puma since high school(24 years ago). I love them. The only issue is the insoles are not attached to the shoe. They pop out every now and again. It’s great though if you want to buy orthotics and put them in yourself.

"
10875,"
i love the style, the feel of the cushion of the sole is nice and soft. the materials are excellent. they are a little long, but that might be my fault in ordering size due to a small difference between EU and US sizing. the product for the price was worth it. i feel i got exactly what i wanted for the price and they came very quickly to my front door step. can't wait to purchase another pair. Pumas are excellent shoes, i had some golf shoes and soccer shoes and now some street kicks. never disappointing.

They look good and have style. Decent comfort. I gave four stars as I feel the middle of section does get narrower than it should. Doesn't effect comfort to much.

I've owned these before...bought again cuz they look pretty fresh (yeh, like early b-boy fresh) and cuz you can get them in wide width.

Got the wide version in black and a white pair regular width. They feel the same on my feet, tight. And that’s not the worst part. I was disappointed in that although the material is synthetic not leather they feel like plastic. And they sound like plastic when you walk in them. Very noisy shoes just from flexing your foot as you walk. It’s not the soles that squeak it’s the synthetic material they are made from. I walked on carpet and you could hear me coming a mile away. Very distracting and annoying. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money on better quality you’ll thank yourself trust me.

These fit my size 13 feet just fine, and were supportive. BUT, these was no loop in the tongues, so the tongues slipped forward into the toe box after only a few steps.

I LOVE Pumas, but the down side is, they don't have that much of a wide foot selection. The TAZON is the ONLY shoe I can find that comes in ""hobbit foot"" sizes. For this shoe, the design is bada$$ and the price was just perfect! They came in with no issues. Would buy from these folks again!
"
10932,"
This color/style has a rubberized outer shell which is fine on most of the shoe, but they used the same material for the tongue so it squeaks relentlessly against the inside of the shoe when you walk around, which does not get less annoying over time. It also causes the tongue to shift out of position to the side more often than other Tazon designs, which is not comfortable. Also, the right heel started to separate from the sole in the first two weeks.Other Tazon variants are good in general, but not this one.

I bought these shoes because I needed something to go with business casual but still be able to basketball with my students. These shoes look great and would be very comfortable but they seem too narrow even though they are wide. This is the 2nd pair of wide Pumas that I have purchased and both were tight. I decided to give these a chance to see if they would break in. They did somewhat but still feel tight. I can live with them until I can afford another pair of shoes.

The shoes feel like pleather cardboard.  Very thin walled.  The foam inserts feel cheap and collapses easily straight to the sole providing no kind of support.  I had to double take at the brand to make sure the brand didn't say something like Fuma as they literally feel generic.  They are supposed to be cross trainers, but I find it unlikely they will last even as walking shoes.

I bought these for work and there very good. I walk about 11-13 miles a day and I'm very happy with these. The cushioning is great. Only thing negative is the tongue of the shoes moves towards the inside of the shoe and can get annoying.

They fit great and are comfortable (maybe a little stiff-feeling), but the real issue was the bottom of the shoe’s print. It allows for tony rocks to get stuck in between, so not recommend for use on gravel.

Not comfortable for standing on your feet all day. Insoles pretty thin so replaced with powerstep inserts and still wouldn’t wear them long hours

I looked at in the store and the regular size was too narrow. Couldn't get a wide size in the store, so ordered through Amazon for the wide size and it's perfect. Very comfortable, very nice looking shoe. I'm very happy with them.

These were supposes to be size 13 wide but are just regular size 13. If they were to send me 13 wide they would have gotten 5 stars but since they did not I think 3 stars is more than fair on my part. I would return them but need shoes now as I ripped m other pair,

I bought these shoes for my teenage son. He's only worn them for 2 months and like some of the other reviews showed, the sole is already pealing off the bottom and the material around it flaking off. One side pealing off all the way back to mid-sole. I've bought many Puma shoes and love them, but these are just trash. I've literally had to buy Gorilla glue to try to salvage these things, but looks like I'll be in the market for another pair of shoes soon. The quality is something that I would expect from a $20 no name brand shoe, not Puma. Highly disappointed.

Puma shoes seem to run so far out of the range of US standards that is so hard to shop for a shoe online. With stores closed this is sometimes the only way to shop for shoes. I like the brand but it's just hard to find a wide shoe that fits properly.

I like to run trails and along the beach. The holes on the top let sand in which is fine if you can dump it out after a run. But the liner keeps the sand from getting into the shoe so you can't dump it out between uses. Pretty soon my shoes are heavy and getting tighter! I had to cut the liner out to let the sand out. POOR DESIGN.

I had to throw these sneakers away after wearing them for several months because the heal cloth was rubbing off and then my ankle was chaffing from the inside of the shoe. It was starting to be painful to wear them even with socks on. The bottom portion of the front started falling off a little while after that. As I walked outside on the streets, the shoes would occasionally collect elements from the ground.These sneakers were nice and fairly comfortable at first. I would not order these again personally.

These shoes are good not great. I had these less than a year and wear them to work everyday I still do, despite the tear in the fabric of the shoes. The soles are comfortable but the fabric on the inside of the shoes are worn out so with that being said I wouldn’t recommend these shoes.

Shoes were way too large for a size 12. Materiels were all synthetic ! Expected leather for the pruce. No arch support. Gave them away as they were far too sloppy of a fit. Looked like a pair of clown shoes with them on. FELT LIKE ONE TOO !!

Shoes are perfect fit for wide feet. Great quality and very nice looking shoes.
"

Bought these specifically because they were listed as wide width which is what my kiddo needs. These are definitely NOT wide. Nor do they even say so anywhere on the show. They’re definitely cute but not at all what I ordered. I hate the crap shoot that is Amazon shopping; so many inaccurate listings that sellers get away with.

I bought these shoes recently. All I do is walk for 5 hours a day in my college in these shoes. Less than a month later the inside of the shoe is ripped up and the leather is starting to peel off the shoe. I already need new sneakers less than a month after buying these. Do NOT buy these.

Fake, rip off, don't buy
"

I would give these zero stars if I could.  The plastic uppers are so thin and weak that they offer no support at all.  Also, when you walk in them, they make a loud sound that sounds like an elephant rubbing its thighs together as it walks.  Wear these to the zoo and compare.  These are terrible shoes.

I purchased these shoes on July 2 2021. As of today the entire sole on the left shoe has fallen off and right shoe is half way there. The insole itself has worn through at the toe. I do not recommended these junky shoes
"

These shoes did not last very long.  It was a great set of shoes but the leather is poor quality and the activity of tying them caused an eyelet to fail.  I rated them for comfort while they lasted.

Probably the worst shoe that I remember owning. No matter how tight you tie the laces, the tongue still slides off to one side. The bottoms are so flat, they almost force you to run flat footed.

Like all other major shoe brands these are wearing out to fast.  Within a month theres a whole under both my feet.  I can get 10 buck pairs and if they last 2 weeks I'm doing better.

I wear a 15 M in shoes. I like to try out different  sneakers in 14 wide because I typically don't like the way my foot looks in a size 15 shoe. The aesthetics of the sneakers are quite pleasing. They have a nice slim look and feel. They run slightly tight with socks--my toe tags the tip of the shoe a bit. However, I'm wearing a size down so I consider these true to fit. I would try a bigger size before switching to a different shoe because I like the style so much.

I have been wearing pumas for years. The feel and fit of the Tazon 6s suited me well. The Axelion's fit ok but the soles feel thin and the material feels wrong compared to what I'm used to with the Tazon 6s. In addition I had them for a couple month they aren't me daily driver and the heels are peeling off already. Paying the usual $75 dollar I was expecting similar quality but this wasn't the case. I might buy another pair of Tazon 6s but I won't buy the Axelions ever again.

I have been wearing pumas for years. The feel and fit of the Tazon 6s suited me well. The Axelion's fit ok but the soles feel thin and the material feels wrong compared to what I'm used to with the Tazon 6s. In addition I had them for a couple month they aren't me daily driver and the heels are peeling off already. Paying the usual $75 dollar I was expecting similar quality but this wasn't the case. I might buy another pair of Tazon 6s but I won't buy the Axelions ever again.

Also, when walking in rain or wet pavement, the toes of the shoes instantly get wet. Won’t buy agin

The quality of this shoe is good.  You can tell it's going to last a long time for a running shoe.  But like most Puma running shoes, the foot box is narrow and that continues all the way to the middle of the arch.  And the way they are made, the foot box will not really stretch after you break the shoes in.  Also, I don't think going with a half size larger would help to avoid this since the toe area is very rigid and almost identical in width with a half size jump.

My husband normally wears 11.5, after reading the reviews I decided to size up to 12.5 and it fits like a glove, great sneakers.  The shoes arrived in a timely manner, the box was a little beaten but it had a pretty lengthy return/exchange window.
"
12052,"
Order your regular size except if you are comparing sizes from Nike… in our experience Nike is numbered in size about a half to a whole size smaller. I had to do a  quick exchange sizing up a whole size because these are all leather and my husband is wearing them with a slightly thicker sock, for fall and winter.  Other than that, he loves them and never needed a breaking in period. These are not what he wears to work, just weekends and running errands.  In the summer he wears a Puma that is mostly made of fabrics and a woven type of material. He is very HAPPY with them!!

"

I had read the reviews about it being a little tighter than it should so got a half size up.  I wish I had gotten a full size up because it was still tight on width and around the toes.  I loosened up the laces a bit and hoped it would widen after a few uses.  It definitely has but more than that, from day 1 the cushion and support on these shoes were just what I had been looking for for the past 2 years. My feet were starting to hurt from the running I do and the shoes I got never had enough support or cushion.  I've tried inserts but they just made the shoe too uncomfortable.  These have done the trick and my foot and shin pain and drastically been reduced.  Only advice I'd give is buy 1 full size up.
"
12061,"
My feet suffer from planter faciatis to the point that shoes rarely are effective at providing comfort for more than 4-5 months. Puma provided the last pair of comfortable shoes in my closet, so I selected this pair to replace them. As expected, these shoes are very comfortable on my feet. I'll buy Puma again down the road. If you are looking at comfortable sports shoes, then Puma ought to be one you consider. Good arch support, a quality tread, nice styling, and a good price point. I recommend these shoes.

Sizes I needed are not available size that should fit but I knew it wouldn't as expected is smaller than US shoe sizes.

These are very comfortable shoes.  I usually wear size 12, but size 13 was just perfect.  These are just very narrow shoes.  If you have a wider foot, I would go elsewhere.  I got the asphalt color and it was very true to the pictures.  They look great and have no marks or manufacturing defects.  At this price point, I think this is a very good value.

Actually they were about 1/2 size small on the length, but they are very narrow.  I was hoping after i fully broke them in they would get better, but to avail.  After about 30 minutes sitting in a lawn chair with the laces fully loose, I'd have to take them off cause they're starting to hurt.

Excelente producto como todos de la marca Puma, me encanta. Lo unico que no me gusto es como el transportista  trato el paquete y lo dejo en mi casa, la caja estaba aplastada y rota, felizmente el producto esta bien, pero para mi que me gusta guardar mis zapatillas en su caja original fue muy molesto ver en las condiciones que estaba la caja.

Just got these in size 13 in the white and red variation.They're pretty snug, the sole is definitely comfy, but the overall finish on them is glossier than I would have liked. Guarantee they're gonna smudge up quickly because they've got that gloss finish on them.Pretty much what you'd expect for the price.

Love love love these shoes!!! I’m a 9.5 W or E, and these have a wide toe box but - they run almost a full size too small… I bought a 10 and they are very snug but comfortable. I bought another pair as 10.5 and almost perfect!

I liked the shoes it is just they don't fit, went on Pumas web site to find out there shoe sizes run small. I received these shoes on Aug 28,2020 ,  who's is the same day I had a hart issue that put me in intensive care for 28 days, and another 7 days in a regular hospital, when I finally returned home my 30 day return policy was up. So I ordered a pair of 10.5 size shoe and received the and enjoy them everyday. But the brand new pair of size 9 and still in the box and other then trying them on they are still brand new. I am sorry about th hospital stay, and both me and my wife being frequent Amozon customers, would like a return authorization on this pair of 9 shoes..  Thanking you in advance for waiving the 30 day policy just once for me, love your customer service.  We have purchased 2 of the Amazon 10.5 tablets and both me nd my wife enjoy them.

I have purchased many Puma products over the last 10 years. I wear a size 8 and this version I had to get a 9. Toes were cramped. I always like the sleek styling and small profile of certain Puma lines. It's a dressy shoe and looks professional.
"

I usually get a size 10 for a little extra wiggle room, but this 10 feels like a 8.5.I read the reviews saying to order a couple sizes larger but I love these colors and they only had a 10. The shoes are good quality but they are almost too small to wear. I might get some elastic laces to hopefully allow the shoes to flex a little.Edit: I replaced the shoelaces with these: 2SPORTIFY 2 Pack No Tie Shoelaces for Kids and Adults - Tieless Elastic Shoe lace for Sneakers Silicone Flat Shoe Laces 2 Pair.They help loosen them up without sacrificing the tightness.

Went from ASICS to puma.Went back to ASICS.  Puma only has the edge in better exterior design. As for fit and comfort, how good these shoes are is subjective.First pair was too small and figured to upsize the shoes and go from there. After a few months the upsized shoes fit right but the overall comfort had no improvement. Soles are just too stiff and don’t soften up with a break in.  I made the mistake of buying two pairs separate from each other and the combined price would have bought me the ASICS, but a foolish gamble and now I have spent twice as much as I should have for good shoes.

The first pair (size 9.5 US - my preferred size is 9.5W US) was small/tight. I returned it and went up the next shoe size (10 US). It's a little tight, but much more tolerable than the 9.5 US.  Definitely comfortable and feels secure when walking/running.

I love Puma shoes. I own multiple pairs and have worn them exclusively for years. Great quality and comfortable, for a 66 year old retired U.S. Marine. (My feet took a pounding, in my Marine Corps career)The seller delivered (via Amazon) right on time. The shoes arrived in good order and were well packed. However, I ordered size 11. The box and shoes are labeled size 11, but these are definitely not size 11. As I said earlier, I own other pairs of Puma shoes and they fit perfectly - size 11. These are size 10 1/2 at best and may be closer to being size 10. I will return them, in the original packaging. Note: This is the first pair of Puma's I've bought online. Every other pair was purchased in a Puma store; where I could try them on and ensure a good fit. With the consistent quality and sizing that I've experienced in the store, I naturally presumed I would have the same fit experience, online. I'm a more savvy buyer now. I'm still sticking with Puma shoes, but buying them online, probably isn't going to be in my future. I'm giving this 3 Stars, because while the buying experience was great, the shoes did not meet my expectations for fit.

"

Strange. I got the peacoat high risk color, and let me start by saying I really thought the color was going to be a light, ashy black color, as the pictures depict. But just so everyone is aware, these shoes are in fact ashy blue, not quite what I was looking for, but I can live.Next, I listened to everyone's advice and where I normally wear a 9.5-10, I opted to buy the 10.5 for this shoe. Boy am I glad I did, as surely a 9.5 would have been way to tight for me. I have been trying to break the shoe before wearing them to work and having to wear them for a straight 7 hours walking around. So far they are still very tight and while the foam is soft, it's not that comfortable of a shoe in fact. So all in all, not a great shoe, but I will be keeping them, as I can see myself still wearing them.

Went from ASICS to puma and back to ASICS.You have to upsize to get a good fit. And comfort level is subpar compared to ASICS.These shoes are for diehard puma fans, soles are to hard for what they are and after months of wearing they still have not softened up and are uncomfortable. Even more uncomfortable than my penny loafers. .

I play street hockey and was curious to see if this shoe would be better than the Puma Tazon 7 that I have used for the past 2 years. The performance is equally good on a textured concrete court under dry and wet conditions. The Cell Surin seems to fit a half size smaller, feels a little stiffer, less pliable... The Tazon fits more like a glove, true to size and the sole lasted longer than the heel cushion. I will be curious to see how long it will take the Cell Surin to wear out.

The reviews stating that this athletic shoe runs small are accurate!  I normally wear a size 9 (M), so I ordered a size 9.5 (M) based on reviews.  I’m glad I did, because a size 9 (M) would have been too small.  The toe box area of the shoe narrows significantly, and the width is more narrow than most other athletic shoe brands.  The 9.5 (M) size I ordered  (1/2 size larger) turned out to be correct, and it actually fits like a Nike 9 (M).  It’s important to note, I have slightly slimmer than normal feet.  Most people with normal width feet would probably need to order a full size up, to accommodate the tight toe box In this shoe’s design.

The first time I ordered the shoes I ordered an 11.5 b/c I usually wear 11 to 11.5 in athletic shoes. I had to send back b/c the 11.5 was too snug on my foot and these shoes are definitely for narrow feet. Although, I could tell they would be a comfortable shoe, I sent the 11.5 back and ordered a size 12. The shoes were delivered in about 2 days and the 12 was definitely the sz I needed and the support and comfort are really good. I have not worn Puma since my high school days when I played basketball, but I'm really glad I bought this pair.

Love this shoe, honestly the most comfortable sole in a sneaker that I’ve experienced.  Shoe is rather narrow right in the center of the foot through to the toe box...if you have wide feet, this shoe is not for you.  I’d say I have average feet width and they are still narrow feeling.  If you are between sizes I’d opt for the 1/2 size larger.  This may alleviate some tightness due to narrowing.  Again, let me repeat that these shoes are extremely comfortable and for the cost the value is tremendous vs. value!

I was surprised the in-sole is extremely soft and comfortable.  Fit overall is perfect.  The best sneakers I ever owned was PUMA.  I love these.  I had to send the first pair back, although my normal size 11, turns out fit was too snug, i had to re-order size 11.5"" . . . and they fit PERFECTLY.  Original ordering info said order normal size , but that was not true for me.  Also, my re-order cost me more than the original special price . . . this was my first-ever RETURN and i had to learn the expensive way that there is no actual 'exchange'.

I'm not going to lie, most everything I've read about these shoes were spot on. 1) Buy at least a half-size larger 2) They are narrow even for my narrow feet 3) The tongue is fine but unless you have perfect form while running or walking it will force you to correct your pronation and it WILL hurt 4) You're sacrificing quality for style 5) After A LOT of breaking in and getting used to them, I love them. The tread seem good, they are snug and firm (which means less moving around in them and they'll last a long time), and they are FLY as HELL. Yes, I said FLY. I get compliments on them and my gf thinks they're sexy.Bottom line: be willing to break these in thoroughly and they'll be worth it. However, they are NOT for avid runners.

My dad is a size 9 1/2 but Its better to buy him a 10 so he can feel comfortable and since I'm a 10, it would feel better if I try it in and see if it fits me and it would be a great gift for him. I bought a 10 size and it felt like It was a 7, super tight and I returned it and I was disappointed because I wanted to get it for my dad for Christmas. BUT Funny how life is, I found it on target and I found a size 10 and felt the same like the one I returned back, then I tried an 11 and it's still tight, then a 12 and its still tight and uncomfortable. then I tried a size 13, and it finally felt like a 10, what the? a 13?????? Even though it was a size 13, thankfully it didn't look like I was wearing some clown shoes, it wasn't that big honestly.The point is, why do I have to choose a size 13 for it to finally fit a person with size 10? Unbelievable, if you're gonna buy a shoe from here, better buy it 3 sizes higher than your actual size.Ex. If you're an 8, pick an 11Don't believe the other comments that say it's true to size or chose one size bigger than your original size

These are the best pair of sneakers I own. After reading the reviews, I deiced to go try a pair on, so I went to our local store and sure enough, I needed a 1/2 size increase. I normally wear size 11, needed 11.5. If I could have gotten these in a wider size, I would have, only because I have an issue on my left foot. Otherwise these feel great. The only complaint I have, I wanted white with Orange, that color has been sold out for over a month, the day I got mine, they had the orange in. That was my only bummer. Amazon has the cheapest price on these and I would definitely recommend these to any of my friends.  I get complements from people every time I wear these.
"

They aren't the most comfy pair of pumas I've owned. They don't have the thing on the tongue to run the laces thru so you have to untie and tie them every time or the tongueslips way down.

Well I went against my better judgment and ignored all the reviews stating that these things are too tight. Sure enough, these fit almost a full size too small.. Toes are scrunched, sides are tight, and the top of my foot looks like it's pushing out the tounge enough to make the laces look silly. Like the Hulk is about to make an appearance lol.. And I have narrow, skinny feet too.Anyway, I read somewhere that the Pumas made in Vietnam fit way smaller than the others. I would recommend these only if you are able to try them on first. The listed size is simply not accurate.As far as the look, they are just what I expected and wanted. They look great with a pair of jeans and the soles appear to be made of good quality. Just too small and now I must deal with the return process.

Shoes look and feel like high quality. They fit as I anticipated. Please remember that if you have wide feet you may want to look into other options for this particular shoe. I would say I have average feet and I had to replace the memory foam inside to make them comfortable. With that being said most shoes do not have that much padding inside of them. They are still super comfy with a smaller memory foam padding inside the shoe and fit perfect. Highly recommend.

The soles are very cushioned and conform well to my feet. My only issue is that the top part near the toe rubs my last 2 toes on the right foot. No issues with the left shoe and I haven't had this issue with other shoes (including Pumas) that I've worn in the past. I'm hoping that it's just a ""breaking in"" issue and that it will subside once I've worn them enough. If not for the rubbing issue, these would be a 5 star shoe.
"
12312,"
Look very stylish and as they are depicted in the images. I do not like the feeling of unstable ground when I wear them. It is like the bottom of your shoes has more than one level. Anyway, maybe I have not worn such shoes before. Materials are not of high quality, but they are suffice for the price. To resume, I would recommend ordering 0.5 size larger for your safety. The sneakers are good if you want to wear inexpensive pumas)

These shoes fit true to size.In some shoes I like ordering them slightly larger than my foot because I feel they are more comfortable, but I feel these are meant to fit perfectly. With that being said normally I wear I size 10.5 but for these I felt more comfortable in a 10. I tried them on first in a local store ($80!) And saw them on Amazon for $57.Great price; great shoe! These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, and right out of the box! I'm coming from a pair of UA shoes that were my favorite shoes ever..

So far so good! These fit as expected. I wear a 10 in Adidas, a 9.5 to 10 in Nike, and 10.5 in various skate shoes (Etnies, DVS, Emerica, Osiris, DC, Vans, etc.). The size is always the trick for me, and these were just right based on a UK 9.5 and a EUR 43-44 - some sizes I try to gauge with when the US sizes are erratic, which they definitely are. I have more narrow feet, so that could be part of why the Puma size was just right; it's possible they require a slightly larger size (half size MAYBE) if you need more width, but they were just as expected for me.

Good looking shoe & quality seems fine. However, unlike other Puma shoes that I have that fit as expected, this shoe is ridiculously tight in front of the arch. I wear a 10 to 10.5 (depending on the shoe). The 10 is fine in length, but the tightness was literally putting my feet to sleep. I bumped up to a 10.5 and it did help, but is still pretty tight. I am working on stretching out the shoe because I really like the design. Time will tell if I will be able to wear these or if they will end up in my donation pile...

For the price that you charge the customer, you'd thing there might be some kind of animal-hide in the construction of this shoe - especially for something made in Viet Nam.

The shoe size fit perfectly to what I expected. The best thing about this shoe is that it is slightly deeper than most low top athletic shoes. I always add an additional orthotic to all my shoes. Low tops are generally too shallow making the top edge of the shoe ride high on my heel when adding an orthotic. These fit perfectly on my heel with the orthotic insert. Very sturdy shoes which is what I prefer over a fabric mesh type shoe. For these reasons Puma in now my go to brand for athletic footwear.

I like the look. I have really high arches,  some support it there when I stretch my foot b4 putting the on.My only frown is that that run a little tight. I think half a size up would have been great.They're still new so hoping breaking them in more will making them even better.

Overall I think this is a pretty nice shoe. I think they are a little too white for me, however I ended up returning them because they are too tight. I usually wear a 11.5 4E but I figured I would give it a try. Typically I have a little bit of toe room, however for these shoes my toe was pushed up against the edge in addition to it being a little tight. I would recommend sizing up a half size in length.
"
12360,"
Do understand that as with most athletic shoes the fit is determined by the independent consitution of the footwear. These are very well cushioned and padded, so it took me three times to get the right fit (so they might run small). I typically wear between an 11 and 12 depending on the shoe. For this case, I tried an 11 first, then 11.5, and finally, the 12 fit just right. Just note that you may have to re-send for a size that works for you. Otherwise, they feel quite solid, and I personally like the style of this brand of Puma sneakers.
"

Most stores in my area only carry Nike and Under Armour. Nobody else gets any shelf space.  Nice to be able to buy a top brand like Puma at Amazon.  Great price for a very well made shoe.

Great fit. Feels like I can lift way more weight when I'm wearing these at the gym. Not for running though. The material as it describes is synthetic. So small wrinkles appear on sides after wearing them a couple time but not a major issue. I've had them for about a month and so far I'm satisfied.

This is a nice looking shoe and comfortable once broken in, however the first week of wearing this shoe was unbearably painful on my little toe. Never had that issue with any of my other 9.5 puma shoes so I am sure its a design flaw. There seems to be some stitching at the tip of the shoe that rubs on your little toe. Had to stuff the top of the shoe with paper for a couple days to stretch it out and then the shoe was wearable.

Head Turner, comfortable, surprisingly light. Shipping was fast and the quality is great. Would buy again.

I wear normally a US size 10 and I ordered a size 10.5 just to be on the safe side. I wished I ordered a size 11. They do fit ok but they feel just about right a bit adjusted on the front of the shoe like a pointy cowboy boot.

This is my second pair I have purchased. I use primarily for HIIT workouts, especially plyometric and cardio. These shoes have excellent traction and grip the floor well. Last pair gave out after one of the lace eyelets ripped out after about 2 years of twice weekly usage. Of my 6 pairs of different brands of workout footwear, these offer the best traction.

I love these shoes.  I would not recommend this shoe for cross-training or running, or anything other than casual wear despite the description.  There is not a lot of cushion, support or comfort for athletic purposes, but the shoe looks great. They are made to last, easy to clean and hold up well. This is my third pair of these shoes and I will probably buy a fourth.

I wore these for one day and probably never will again.  They crush my toes too tightly on my right foot,  and hurt my toes. I give two stars because they're beautiful shoes, but they're headed for a yard sale or to Goodwill.  I feel so ripped off with these shoes.

Very comfortable shoes. Fit well. This particular pair does not breath to well. The other pair (pumas) breath fine, but these are different so my feet will warm up even with thin Sox on. It does not cause discomfort, but it is noticeable. Great during the winter, not so good for the summer

"

I tried to wear these for a couple months, and finally just gave up. They are WAY too stiff, and never really broke in. Feet were constantly in pain after walking in them, but I kept trying hoping they would loosen. Never happened. They still look almost brand new, sitting on the shoe rack, probably never to worn again. Lame.Added a star for materials quality, which I've found with Puma to be usually high, and these were no different.

This was a Christmas/End of year gift for my boyfriend. He just loved it and wear it right away at office  where I sent them, to show off to his coworkers 😅☺️. They were true to size and very comfortable and well-cushioned, also look nice and stylish for a casual outfit.

I like the white, grey, and black combination of colors of this shoe.  I have several pairs of Puma's that are similar to this style.  It fits nicely, has a soft inter cushion, and a nice tread.  The shoes are very comfortable and look good with jeans or casual slacks.

Shoes were very tight. Hard to return something once you've unpacked and worn them for a while. Fortunately I was able to give them to my 12 yr old son, but I don't know how on-line is going to work if you can't rely on sizes to be consistent.
"

I think these definitely run a little smaller than your regular size shoes; I would definitely order at least a half size up. These are snug, but super comfortable otherwise. I will definitely order them again, a half size larger. Plus they just look so darn cool!
"
12442,"
I like Puma but it feels like the fitting of shoes are more for narrow feet. I'm female and bought a size 7 men's size and it's quite snug. Or needs some breaking in. I just got it today so can't really say much yet. I mainly bought this pair for work. Not a big fan of synthetic leather but it's required for work. This shoes feels like plastic to me. And it does make a fold crease as stated by other buyer. Will update in a week or 2.

The toe portion is really wide and loose. Even someone with wide feet will complain. The heel is lower than the toe so it feels like you're always walking uphill. No arch support. The look is a reminder of Nike Shox, but no where near the quality. The rubber in the toe was wrinkling after 3 hours of wear. Sent both pairs back immediately.

Thank God I red the reviews before I ordered them cuz I would have never thought to order a size bigger. Some said half size bigger but Men should order a whole size bigger to be safe.

t looks very nice, Its a bit narrow compared to other sneakers. I ordered a size 10.5 it was a bit small. i tried to get a 11 but they didnt have it available in that size.

However, you might want to order a size bigger. ex: if you are a 10 you might want to get a 10.5

Love the style and layout.  Very much dislike that the uppers are not leather.  I knew they were not leather before purchase as the description says so.  First pair I've bought like this and wanted to try.  They seem to breathe ok but the white uppers hold dirt like some sort of pvc.  They just don't break-in the same as real leather.  For $80, I won't experiment again.

They are sharp looking shoe, absolutely. But I've been wearing my Footjoy golf shoes (spikeless) to the gym and needed to replace those. So the Puma's are a bit stiff and just a bit tight. I'm hoping they will loosen up and not be either tight or stiff in a month or so. I only use them to exercise 3x per week, so it could take a while. That's it...

"
12501,"
I've owned two pairs of these shoes. They're comfortable and overall well made, HOWEVER, the eyelets have nothing to brace them against the pressure of the laces running through them and so you'll find that long before any other parts of the shoe wear out you will experience one or more of the eyelets being torn open and ruining the shoe. A shame because this is a very comfortable pair of shoes that can be worn for extended periods of time. If the eyelets are given some support with plastic or metal eyelet rings they could be 5 stars with ease. Until then, they can't be recommended and I won't be buying another pair. I certainly won't be buying another pair of Pumas that don't have some sort of support for their eyelets regardless of the style of the shoe.

UPDATE: I wore these shoes for less than 3 months and they are done! Wore hole clean through them. These shoes are not good quality.  I ordered a half size larger (11.5) than my normal size (11) and the shoe is still very tight. Particularly tight across the wide part of the front of the foot and the toe box. I wouldn’t want to go to a size 12 because the length gets too long. Arch support seems good (I have very flat feet). The shoes look great! I’m hoping I can actually wear them.

Back of shoe falling apart within weeks of purchase!I've bought a few PUMAS online through Amazon and this shoe is already falling apart at the ""rim of ankle"" on both runners.I've still got older pumas that are well over several years old (from Amazon) without that issue.VERY disappointing to pay so much for a shoe that is only used for daily workouts...NO CARDIO!!!*Will post pictures taken with the first shoe weeks back and recently with now the other doing the same.

Appearance: Excellent, will receive compliments. Clear puma logo stitched into the leather that withstands bumps and scuffs.Durability: Good+Size: Good, slightly stiff due to the leather toe-box construction.Recommendation: For CASUAL WEAR ONLY, these WILL give you blisters if you try running in them like I did (3 miles). These are only good  for light walking and light standing. Do not attempt to wear these to work if you are a nurse!

I have had several Puma shoes and they all are pretty much the same designed shoes with differences to the detailing and all have fit very well.  However, this version is very tight on the top of the foot.  After 12 hrs of working on my feet with these shoes, the pain was extreme.  With the material not being leather, there is no stretch to fit and limiting to the natural bending of feet with movement.

I wear almost the exact same design puma shoe that i purchased from a brick and mortor store a couple years ago but they are finally wearing out. I bought these replacements since its identical minus minor tweaks to the swoop design. When i tried these on they felt much tighter than my others around the ball of my foot and squeek like crazy when i walk. I thought maybe they just needed to be broken in but that hasnt helped. Embarrassingly noisy to walk in like they made the rubber/leather material too tight fitting and its rubbing or stretching as you walk. Look great but i dont wear them for the noise and tight fit

"

I purchased this pair of shoes specifically because I already own this exact same pair and they are the most comfortable shoe I've found to stand on my feet in 10+ hours a day. The first pair I purchased in a big name store. I decided to purchase online this time because I couldn't find the same pair in my size, in store. I am highly disappointed. The size isn't accurate and the width is much more narrow than the previous pair. This is the first and only time I will ever purchase a pair of shoes online.

Liked the design and appearance. Hated the sole and rigidity of the shoe. Felt like I was buckling on metal boots. Parts hit the sides of my ankle and the material was so hard it literally hurt to wear them. The sole felt uneven and super flat with absolutely no cushion. Great looking shoe, but the most uncomfortable shoe I've even worn. Returned them right away.

Fit was great. I loved the look of the shoe! Got a scuff on the toe, of course, and could not get it cleaned 100%. When using a stronger chemical, it just eats the white coating off. Wear only on carpet and do not rub them on anything! LoLUpdate 1/27/2023 : You, go with another pair of Pumas. Their “leather” sucks and the color comes off easily, whether white or black.

The quality of this shoe is good.  You can tell it's going to last a long time for a running shoe.  But like most Puma running shoes, the foot box is narrow and that continues all the way to the middle of the arch.  And the way they are made, the foot box will not really stretch after you break the shoes in.  Also, I don't think going with a half size larger would help to avoid this since the toe area is very rigid and almost identical in width with a half size jump.

My husband normally wears 11.5, after reading the reviews I decided to size up to 12.5 and it fits like a glove, great sneakers.  The shoes arrived in a timely manner, the box was a little beaten but it had a pretty lengthy return/exchange window.
"
13052,"
Order your regular size except if you are comparing sizes from Nike… in our experience Nike is numbered in size about a half to a whole size smaller. I had to do a  quick exchange sizing up a whole size because these are all leather and my husband is wearing them with a slightly thicker sock, for fall and winter.  Other than that, he loves them and never needed a breaking in period. These are not what he wears to work, just weekends and running errands.  In the summer he wears a Puma that is mostly made of fabrics and a woven type of material. He is very HAPPY with them!!

Love the design and comfort of the shoe but only when you get a size that fits.  Ordered my size and it was too small as the fit was too tight. Reordered one full size larger and it fit perfectly.
"
13060,"
I had read the reviews about it being a little tighter than it should so got a half size up.  I wish I had gotten a full size up because it was still tight on width and around the toes.  I loosened up the laces a bit and hoped it would widen after a few uses.  It definitely has but more than that, from day 1 the cushion and support on these shoes were just what I had been looking for for the past 2 years. My feet were starting to hurt from the running I do and the shoes I got never had enough support or cushion.  I've tried inserts but they just made the shoe too uncomfortable.  These have done the trick and my foot and shin pain and drastically been reduced.  Only advice I'd give is buy 1 full size up.
"
13061,"
My feet suffer from planter faciatis to the point that shoes rarely are effective at providing comfort for more than 4-5 months. Puma provided the last pair of comfortable shoes in my closet, so I selected this pair to replace them. As expected, these shoes are very comfortable on my feet. I'll buy Puma again down the road. If you are looking at comfortable sports shoes, then Puma ought to be one you consider. Good arch support, a quality tread, nice styling, and a good price point. I recommend these shoes.

Really like the look of these shoes and have gotten a lot of positive feedback on them as they have certainly gone noticed around work and family.I am still wearing them in but have noticed that the shoe is certainly tighter than the other shoes I ordered at the same times. After a whole of wearing my feet do start to feel cramped and I end up ready to take them off. Hence the three stars

Actually they were about 1/2 size small on the length, but they are very narrow.  I was hoping after i fully broke them in they would get better, but to avail.  After about 30 minutes sitting in a lawn chair with the laces fully loose, I'd have to take them off cause they're starting to hurt.

Just got these in size 13 in the white and red variation.They're pretty snug, the sole is definitely comfy, but the overall finish on them is glossier than I would have liked.

Love love love these shoes!!! I’m a 9.5 W or E, and these have a wide toe box but - they run almost a full size too small… I bought a 10 and they are very snug but comfortable. I bought another pair as 10.5 and almost perfect!

I liked the shoes it is just they don't fit, went on Pumas web site to find out there shoe sizes run small. I received these shoes on Aug 28,2020 ,  who's is the same day I had a hart issue that put me in intensive care for 28 days, and another 7 days in a regular hospital, when I finally returned home my 30 day return policy was up. So I ordered a pair of 10.5 size shoe and received the and enjoy them everyday. But the brand new pair of size 9 and still in the box and other then trying them on they are still brand new. I am sorry about th hospital stay, and both me and my wife being frequent Amozon customers, would like a return authorization on this pair of 9 shoes..  Thanking you in advance for waiving the 30 day policy just once for me, love your customer service.  We have purchased 2 of the Amazon 10.5 tablets and both me nd my wife enjoy them.

I have purchased many Puma products over the last 10 years. I wear a size 8 and this version I had to get a 9. Toes were cramped. I always like the sleek styling and small profile of certain Puma lines. It's a dressy shoe and looks professional.
"

I usually get a size 10 for a little extra wiggle room, but this 10 feels like a 8.5.I read the reviews saying to order a couple sizes larger but I love these colors and they only had a 10. The shoes are good quality but they are almost too small to wear. I might get some elastic laces to hopefully allow the shoes to flex a little.Edit: I replaced the shoelaces with these: 2SPORTIFY 2 Pack No Tie Shoelaces for Kids and Adults - Tieless Elastic Shoe lace for Sneakers Silicone Flat Shoe Laces 2 Pair.They help loosen them up without sacrificing the tightness.

Went from ASICS to puma.Went back to ASICS.  Puma only has the edge in better exterior design. As for fit and comfort, how good these shoes are is subjective.First pair was too small and figured to upsize the shoes and go from there. After a few months the upsized shoes fit right but the overall comfort had no improvement. Soles are just too stiff and don’t soften up with a break in.  I made the mistake of buying two pairs separate from each other and the combined price would have bought me the ASICS, but a foolish gamble and now I have spent twice as much as I should have for good shoes.

The first pair (size 9.5 US - my preferred size is 9.5W US) was small/tight. I returned it and went up the next shoe size (10 US). It's a little tight, but much more tolerable than the 9.5 US.  Definitely comfortable and feels secure when walking/running.

I love Puma shoes. I own multiple pairs and have worn them exclusively for years. Great quality and comfortable, for a 66 year old retired U.S. Marine. (My feet took a pounding, in my Marine Corps career)The seller delivered (via Amazon) right on time. The shoes arrived in good order and were well packed. However, I ordered size 11. The box and shoes are labeled size 11, but these are definitely not size 11. As I said earlier, I own other pairs of Puma shoes and they fit perfectly - size 11. These are size 10 1/2 at best and may be closer to being size 10. I will return them, in the original packaging. Note: This is the first pair of Puma's I've bought online. Every other pair was purchased in a Puma store; where I could try them on and ensure a good fit. With the consistent quality and sizing that I've experienced in the store, I naturally presumed I would have the same fit experience, online. I'm a more savvy buyer now. I'm still sticking with Puma shoes, but buying them online, probably isn't going to be in my future. I'm giving this 3 Stars, because while the buying experience was great, the shoes did not meet my expectations for fit.

Strange. I got the peacoat high risk color, and let me start by saying I really thought the color was going to be a light, ashy black color, as the pictures depict. But just so everyone is aware, these shoes are in fact ashy blue, not quite what I was looking for, but I can live.Next, I listened to everyone's advice and where I normally wear a 9.5-10, I opted to buy the 10.5 for this shoe. Boy am I glad I did, as surely a 9.5 would have been way to tight for me. I have been trying to break the shoe before wearing them to work and having to wear them for a straight 7 hours walking around. So far they are still very tight and while the foam is soft, it's not that comfortable of a shoe in fact. So all in all, not a great shoe, but I will be keeping them, as I can see myself still wearing them.

Went from ASICS to puma and back to ASICS.You have to upsize to get a good fit. And comfort level is subpar compared to ASICS.These shoes are for diehard puma fans, soles are to hard for what they are and after months of wearing they still have not softened up and are uncomfortable. Even more uncomfortable than my penny loafers. .

I play street hockey and was curious to see if this shoe would be better than the Puma Tazon 7 that I have used for the past 2 years. The performance is equally good on a textured concrete court under dry and wet conditions. The Cell Surin seems to fit a half size smaller, feels a little stiffer, less pliable... The Tazon fits more like a glove, true to size and the sole lasted longer than the heel cushion. I will be curious to see how long it will take the Cell Surin to wear out.

The reviews stating that this athletic shoe runs small are accurate!  I normally wear a size 9 (M), so I ordered a size 9.5 (M) based on reviews.  I’m glad I did, because a size 9 (M) would have been too small.  The toe box area of the shoe narrows significantly, and the width is more narrow than most other athletic shoe brands.  The 9.5 (M) size I ordered  (1/2 size larger) turned out to be correct, and it actually fits like a Nike 9 (M).  It’s important to note, I have slightly slimmer than normal feet.  Most people with normal width feet would probably need to order a full size up, to accommodate the tight toe box In this shoe’s design.

The first time I ordered the shoes I ordered an 11.5 b/c I usually wear 11 to 11.5 in athletic shoes. I had to send back b/c the 11.5 was too snug on my foot and these shoes are definitely for narrow feet. Although, I could tell they would be a comfortable shoe, I sent the 11.5 back and ordered a size 12. The shoes were delivered in about 2 days and the 12 was definitely the sz I needed and the support and comfort are really good. I have not worn Puma since my high school days when I played basketball, but I'm really glad I bought this pair.

Love this shoe, honestly the most comfortable sole in a sneaker that I’ve experienced.  Shoe is rather narrow right in the center of the foot through to the toe box...if you have wide feet, this shoe is not for you.  I’d say I have average feet width and they are still narrow feeling.  If you are between sizes I’d opt for the 1/2 size larger.  This may alleviate some tightness due to narrowing.  Again, let me repeat that these shoes are extremely comfortable and for the cost the value is tremendous vs. value!

Original ordering info said order normal size , but that was not true for me.  Also, my re-order cost me more than the original special price . . . this was my first-ever RETURN and i had to learn the expensive way that there is no actual 'exchange'.

I'm not going to lie, most everything I've read about these shoes were spot on. 1) Buy at least a half-size larger 2) They are narrow even for my narrow feet 3) The tongue is fine but unless you have perfect form while running or walking it will force you to correct your pronation and it WILL hurt 4) You're sacrificing quality for style 5) After A LOT of breaking in and getting used to them, I love them. The tread seem good, they are snug and firm (which means less moving around in them and they'll last a long time), and they are FLY as HELL. Yes, I said FLY. I get compliments on them and my gf thinks they're sexy.Bottom line: be willing to break these in thoroughly and they'll be worth it. However, they are NOT for avid runners.

Comfortable. True to size. Trendy. Can be worn for hours comfortably. Great shoe in so many ways!But walk in the rain and get them sopping wet one time and they're done. They'll stink awful, forever, and they'll never be the same again. Not cool.

My dad is a size 9 1/2 but Its better to buy him a 10 so he can feel comfortable and since I'm a 10, it would feel better if I try it in and see if it fits me and it would be a great gift for him. I bought a 10 size and it felt like It was a 7, super tight and I returned it and I was disappointed because I wanted to get it for my dad for Christmas. BUT Funny how life is, I found it on target and I found a size 10 and felt the same like the one I returned back, then I tried an 11 and it's still tight, then a 12 and its still tight and uncomfortable. then I tried a size 13, and it finally felt like a 10, what the? a 13?????? Even though it was a size 13, thankfully it didn't look like I was wearing some clown shoes, it wasn't that big honestly.The point is, why do I have to choose a size 13 for it to finally fit a person with size 10? Unbelievable, if you're gonna buy a shoe from here, better buy it 3 sizes higher than your actual size.Ex. If you're an 8, pick an 11Don't believe the other comments that say it's true to size or chose one size bigger than your original size

These shoes are narrow. I read this in other reviews and I thought once I broke them in the shoes would fit great but even after breaking them in they are still narrow and  right on the sides of your foot but over all I like the style and look of the shoes and the cost was low.

These are the best pair of sneakers I own. After reading the reviews, I deiced to go try a pair on, so I went to our local store and sure enough, I needed a 1/2 size increase. I normally wear size 11, needed 11.5. If I could have gotten these in a wider size, I would have, only because I have an issue on my left foot. Otherwise these feel great. The only complaint I have, I wanted white with Orange, that color has been sold out for over a month, the day I got mine, they had the orange in. That was my only bummer. Amazon has the cheapest price on these and I would definitely recommend these to any of my friends.  I get complements from people every time I wear these.
"
13278,"
They aren't the most comfy pair of pumas I've owned. They don't have the thing on the tongue to run the laces thru so you have to untie and tie them every time or the tongueslips way down. My last pair of puma shoes were awesome these are okay at best. I've worn them for about a month and they're still fairly stiff.

These are just fashion shoes. They don't even look that good. I only wore them a few times. They kind of remind me of bowling shoes..

I probably wore these for a week or two then was tired of them. Now they will likely get donated.

Well I went against my better judgment and ignored all the reviews stating that these things are too tight. Sure enough, these fit almost a full size too small.. Toes are scrunched, sides are tight, and the top of my foot looks like it's pushing out the tounge enough to make the laces look silly. Like the Hulk is about to make an appearance lol.. And I have narrow, skinny feet too.Anyway, I read somewhere that the Pumas made in Vietnam fit way smaller than the others. I would recommend these only if you are able to try them on first. The listed size is simply not accurate.As far as the look, they are just what I expected and wanted. They look great with a pair of jeans and the soles appear to be made of good quality. Just too small and now I must deal with the return process.

Shoes look and feel like high quality. They fit as I anticipated. Please remember that if you have wide feet you may want to look into other options for this particular shoe. I would say I have average feet and I had to replace the memory foam inside to make them comfortable. With that being said most shoes do not have that much padding inside of them. They are still super comfy with a smaller memory foam padding inside the shoe and fit perfect. Highly recommend.

The soles are very cushioned and conform well to my feet. My only issue is that the top part near the toe rubs my last 2 toes on the right foot. No issues with the left shoe and I haven't had this issue with other shoes (including Pumas) that I've worn in the past. I'm hoping that it's just a ""breaking in"" issue and that it will subside once I've worn them enough. If not for the rubbing issue, these would be a 5 star shoe.
"
13312,"
Look very stylish and as they are depicted in the images. I do not like the feeling of unstable ground when I wear them. It is like the bottom of your shoes has more than one level. Anyway, maybe I have not worn such shoes before. Materials are not of high quality, but they are suffice for the price. To resume, I would recommend ordering 0.5 size larger for your safety. The sneakers are good if you want to wear inexpensive pumas)

These shoes fit true to size.In some shoes I like ordering them slightly larger than my foot because I feel they are more comfortable, but I feel these are meant to fit perfectly. With that being said normally I wear I size 10.5 but for these I felt more comfortable in a 10. I tried them on first in a local store ($80!) And saw them on Amazon for $57.Great price; great shoe! These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, and right out of the box! I'm coming from a pair of UA shoes that were my favorite shoes ever..

So far so good! These fit as expected. I wear a 10 in Adidas, a 9.5 to 10 in Nike, and 10.5 in various skate shoes (Etnies, DVS, Emerica, Osiris, DC, Vans, etc.). The size is always the trick for me, and these were just right based on a UK 9.5 and a EUR 43-44 - some sizes I try to gauge with when the US sizes are erratic, which they definitely are. I have more narrow feet, so that could be part of why the Puma size was just right; it's possible they require a slightly larger size (half size MAYBE) if you need more width, but they were just as expected for me.

"
13336,"
Good looking shoe & quality seems fine. However, unlike other Puma shoes that I have that fit as expected, this shoe is ridiculously tight in front of the arch. I wear a 10 to 10.5 (depending on the shoe). The 10 is fine in length, but the tightness was literally putting my feet to sleep. I bumped up to a 10.5 and it did help, but is still pretty tight. I am working on stretching out the shoe because I really like the design. Time will tell if I will be able to wear these or if they will end up in my donation pile...

For the price that you charge the customer, you'd thing there might be some kind of animal-hide in the construction of this shoe - especially for something made in Viet Nam.

My Birthday recipient, loved the style and design. Does say that the shoes are kind loose around the bottom of the ankle. But the toe supports him just the way he had hoped for.
"

The shoe size fit perfectly to what I expected. The best thing about this shoe is that it is slightly deeper than most low top athletic shoes. I always add an additional orthotic to all my shoes. Low tops are generally too shallow making the top edge of the shoe ride high on my heel when adding an orthotic. These fit perfectly on my heel with the orthotic insert. Very sturdy shoes which is what I prefer over a fabric mesh type shoe. For these reasons Puma in now my go to brand for athletic footwear.

I like the look. I have really high arches,  some support it there when I stretch my foot b4 putting the on.My only frown is that that run a little tight. I think half a size up would have been great.They're still new so hoping breaking them in more will making them even better.

Overall I think this is a pretty nice shoe. I think they are a little too white for me, however I ended up returning them because they are too tight. I usually wear a 11.5 4E but I figured I would give it a try. Typically I have a little bit of toe room, however for these shoes my toe was pushed up against the edge in addition to it being a little tight. I would recommend sizing up a half size in length.
"
13360,"
Do understand that as with most athletic shoes the fit is determined by the independent consitution of the footwear. These are very well cushioned and padded, so it took me three times to get the right fit (so they might run small). I typically wear between an 11 and 12 depending on the shoe. For this case, I tried an 11 first, then 11.5, and finally, the 12 fit just right. Just note that you may have to re-send for a size that works for you. Otherwise, they feel quite solid, and I personally like the style of this brand of Puma sneakers.
"
13361,"
Most stores in my area only carry Nike and Under Armour. Nobody else gets any shelf space.  Nice to be able to buy a top brand like Puma at Amazon.  Great price for a very well made shoe.

Great fit. Feels like I can lift way more weight when I'm wearing these at the gym. Not for running though. The material as it describes is synthetic. So small wrinkles appear on sides after wearing them a couple time but not a major issue. I've had them for about a month and so far I'm satisfied.

All good and perfect conditions. I don't use them for running so I cannot judge them on this performance, but when worn daily they are comfortable. Washed them several times in the washing machine and no problem with the colors or something else.

This is a nice looking shoe and comfortable once broken in, however the first week of wearing this shoe was unbearably painful on my little toe. Never had that issue with any of my other 9.5 puma shoes so I am sure its a design flaw. There seems to be some stitching at the tip of the shoe that rubs on your little toe. Had to stuff the top of the shoe with paper for a couple days to stretch it out and then the shoe was wearable.

Head Turner, comfortable, surprisingly light. Shipping was fast and the quality is great. Would buy again. Thank you!Size runs kind of adjusted, for a more accurate fit order a number larger than your normal size for a comfortable fit.I.e. I wear normally a US size 10 and I ordered a size 10.5 just to be on the safe side. I wished I ordered a size 11. They do fit ok but they feel just about right a bit adjusted on the front of the shoe like a pointy cowboy boot.

I read all the reviews.  I wear a 10.5 in women's.  I love men's shoes cause let's be honest my size women shoes are ugly. I bought a 9.5 men's.  It was perfect fit. Great room for toes and so so comfy.  I love my pumas!💖😀

It's always a good idea to read reviews before purchase.  Had l not, these shoes would've been way to small for my foot.  I went a size up and they still were tight.  After walking around for 5mins they broke in and now feels comfortable.  I have back aches and these shoes provide the support I need.
"

Size was true to size, but for running and support no way. Moderatley uncomfortable and dense where flex should be. Too heavy for a running shoe but very good looking. Beuty is pain, huh.

I needed a pair of Nikes, but couldn't find what I liked.  So, I loved the ways these looked.  Even though it was a men's shoe, I gave it a go.  I like these shoes because they are lighter than my Nike leather shoes.  These shoes look AMAZING and I get complements ALL the time.

This is my second pair I have purchased. I use primarily for HIIT workouts, especially plyometric and cardio. These shoes have excellent traction and grip the floor well. Last pair gave out after one of the lace eyelets ripped out after about 2 years of twice weekly usage. Of my 6 pairs of different brands of workout footwear, these offer the best traction.
"

I love these shoes.  I would not recommend this shoe for cross-training or running, or anything other than casual wear despite the description.  There is not a lot of cushion, support or comfort for athletic purposes, but the shoe looks great. They are made to last, easy to clean and hold up well. This is my third pair of these shoes and I will probably buy a fourth.

I wore these for one day and probably never will again.  They crush my toes too tightly on my right foot,  and hurt my toes. I give two stars because they're beautiful shoes, but they're headed for a yard sale or to Goodwill.  I feel so ripped off with these shoes.

Very comfortable shoes. Fit well. This particular pair does not breath to well. The other pair (pumas) breath fine, but these are different so my feet will warm up even with thin Sox on. It does not cause discomfort, but it is noticeable. Great during the winter, not so good for the summer

I tried to wear these for a couple months, and finally just gave up. They are WAY too stiff, and never really broke in. Feet were constantly in pain after walking in them, but I kept trying hoping they would loosen. Never happened. They still look almost brand new, sitting on the shoe rack, probably never to worn again. Lame.Added a star for materials quality, which I've found with Puma to be usually high, and these were no different.

This was a Christmas/End of year gift for my boyfriend. He just loved it and wear it right away at office  where I sent them, to show off to his coworkers 😅☺️. They were true to size and very comfortable and well-cushioned, also look nice and stylish for a casual outfit.

Shoes were very tight. Hard to return something once you've unpacked and worn them for a while. Fortunately I was able to give them to my 12 yr old son, but I don't know how on-line is going to work if you can't rely on sizes to be consistent.
"

I think these definitely run a little smaller than your regular size shoes; I would definitely order at least a half size up. These are snug, but super comfortable otherwise. I will definitely order them again, a half size larger. Plus they just look so darn cool!
"
13442,"
I like Puma but it feels like the fitting of shoes are more for narrow feet. I'm female and bought a size 7 men's size and it's quite snug. Or needs some breaking in. I just got it today so can't really say much yet. I mainly bought this pair for work. Not a big fan of synthetic leather but it's required for work. This shoes feels like plastic to me. And it does make a fold crease as stated by other buyer. Will update in a week or 2.

The toe portion is really wide and loose. Even someone with wide feet will complain. The heel is lower than the toe so it feels like you're always walking uphill. No arch support. The look is a reminder of Nike Shox, but no where near the quality. The rubber in the toe was wrinkling after 3 hours of wear. Sent both pairs back immediately.

t looks very nice, Its a bit narrow compared to other sneakers. I ordered a size 10.5 it was a bit small. i tried to get a 11 but they didnt have it available in that size.

However, you might want to order a size bigger. ex: if you are a 10 you might want to get a 10.5

Love the style and layout.  Very much dislike that the uppers are not leather.  I knew they were not leather before purchase as the description says so.

For $80, I won't experiment again.

They are sharp looking shoe, absolutely. But I've been wearing my Footjoy golf shoes (spikeless) to the gym and needed to replace those. So the Puma's are a bit stiff and just a bit tight.

"
13501,"
I've owned two pairs of these shoes. They're comfortable and overall well made, HOWEVER, the eyelets have nothing to brace them against the pressure of the laces running through them and so you'll find that long before any other parts of the shoe wear out you will experience one or more of the eyelets being torn open and ruining the shoe. A shame because this is a very comfortable pair of shoes that can be worn for extended periods of time. If the eyelets are given some support with plastic or metal eyelet rings they could be 5 stars with ease. Until then, they can't be recommended and I won't be buying another pair. I certainly won't be buying another pair of Pumas that don't have some sort of support for their eyelets regardless of the style of the shoe.

I ordered a half size larger (11.5) than my normal size (11) and the shoe is still very tight. Particularly tight across the wide part of the front of the foot and the toe box. I wouldn’t want to go to a size 12 because the length gets too long. Arch support seems good (I have very flat feet). The shoes look great! I’m hoping I can actually wear them.

But when he received these shoes, they fit perfect.  He has worn them everyday since, with no complaining.  I would give them 10 stars if I could.

These are only good  for light walking and light standing. Do not attempt to wear these to work if you are a nurse!

I have had several Puma shoes and they all are pretty much the same designed shoes with differences to the detailing and all have fit very well.  However, this version is very tight on the top of the foot.  After 12 hrs of working on my feet with these shoes, the pain was extreme.  With the material not being leather, there is no stretch to fit and limiting to the natural bending of feet with movement.

I wear almost the exact same design puma shoe that i purchased from a brick and mortor store a couple years ago but they are finally wearing out. I bought these replacements since its identical minus minor tweaks to the swoop design. When i tried these on they felt much tighter than my others around the ball of my foot and squeek like crazy when i walk. I thought maybe they just needed to be broken in but that hasnt helped. Embarrassingly noisy to walk in like they made the rubber/leather material too tight fitting and its rubbing or stretching as you walk. Look great but i dont wear them for the noise and tight fit

I purchased this pair of shoes specifically because I already own this exact same pair and they are the most comfortable shoe I've found to stand on my feet in 10+ hours a day. The first pair I purchased in a big name store. I decided to purchase online this time because I couldn't find the same pair in my size, in store. I am highly disappointed. The size isn't accurate and the width is much more narrow than the previous pair. This is the first and only time I will ever purchase a pair of shoes online.

Liked the design and appearance. Hated the sole and rigidity of the shoe. Felt like I was buckling on metal boots. Parts hit the sides of my ankle and the material was so hard it literally hurt to wear them. The sole felt uneven and super flat with absolutely no cushion. Great looking shoe, but the most uncomfortable shoe I've even worn. Returned them right away.

Fit was great. I loved the look of the shoe! Got a scuff on the toe, of course, and could not get it cleaned 100%. When using a stronger chemical, it just eats the white coating off. Wear only on carpet and do not rub them on anything! LoLUpdate 1/27/2023 : You, go with another pair of Pumas. Their “leather” sucks and the color comes off easily, whether white or black.

I was looking for a pair of ""spike-less"" golf shoes. I came across these on Amazon and ordered them in 10 1/2 which is my normal size. The came quicker than the expected ship time. They are super comfortable. I played 18 in them yesterday and didn't even realize I was wearing them. The studs on the bottom gave me plenty of grip and my feet stayed cool in the 100 degree Arizona heat.

A good shoe, except that inside the shoe there is a seam on the right (or left depending on the show) that bores into the side of the foot at its widest; seems to diminish as they get broken in.

Super comfortable and and breathable. Not water resistant. The fabric is mesh. It may not soak up water like a sponge, but your feet will be wet immediately.  I’m not complaining just starting the fact. I love them!

"

At first I did not like the shoes. There were two hard pieces near the front third (near the base of the toes) that cut into my foot. After a handful of uses the hard pieces became more flexible and dug less into my skin.  I would say there are better shoes out there, but these ones are great and are comfortable after you break them in.

Very comfortable once I put some duct tape over the inside stitching seams. Very light and grip well. My favorite golf shoe now (I have 6 pairs to choose from).
"
14091,"
I've been looking for the ""non aggressive"" style of golf shoe for a while.  What I mean by that is the bottom of the shoes don't lock your feet to the ground while you swing.  I've played a few rounds with them and absolutely love them.  Everyone I've golfed with was impressed with the look and even more so when I told them the price.  I'm not a daily or weekly golfer, so I can't speak to anyone who plays all the time.  As someone who plays a handful or rounds a year, I'm impressed with the comfort of them.  It really does feel like you're wearing a comfy pair of tennis shoes.
"
14092,"
Very comfortable, lightweight.
"
14093,"
Overall its a great shoe. My only thing to note as a negative is that there's a seam towards the end of the shoe inside (hits just beneath your toes) that is very awkwardly placed. Was quite uncomfortable at first, but about 25min walking around in them i didn't notice it anymore. Just something to consider if purchasing; once broken in a little bit it mostly went way, but may not be worth the risk if you can find a better deal on another pair. I got these super on sale, so for me it was totally worth it.
"
14094,"
Just played my first round with these. Grip is great. Lightweight and fairly comfortable. The issues, insole is a little to be desired, but you can change that out. I did. As for the quality, it is “meh” to me. The stitching where the uppers meet the toe box dig into your outside-inside parts of your foot. Simple fix, throw some duck tape in there to tape back the stitching “lump” that is created when you slide these on. The support of the upper is ok, but if you generate a lot of torque or pressure on the outside of your left foot... be careful. The only really downside to this shoe is the stitching where the uppers meet the toe box. It is horrible and surprised that Puma let it go. Not an everyday golf show in my opinion, but for a weekend hack like me it will work fine. UPDATE: After three rounds in the eyelets are starting to separate from the fabric. IMO this is poor construction and quality. Still lightweight and comfortable, but the craftsmanship is horrible and why they would make the uppers with the mesh like fabric is beyond me. A solid composite upper would support better and withstand the use. Downgraded to 2 stars.
"

Something about how the tongue attaches leaves something folded that your foot can feel. Now, this can be adjusted, but it’s annoying to have to readjust every time I put the shoe on

I bought the gray and yellow as well as the black and white pair. They are easy to get on, due to the lacing and tongue system are easy to loosen and tighten. They have a great wide toebox for added comfort. The Grip Fusion cleat system is legit. On the shortest of grass (and hard surface), I had great traction, no slipping whatsoever. I've had them for 3 weeks and have used them a lot and have little wear. They are so comfortable, I find myself wearing them the whole day even when I have errands to run after golf. Past golf shoes you can't wait to get them off. Highly recommend.
"

Put them on , and walked the 18 holes on the golf course which is close to 6 miles. Shoes were nice and comfortable . Grass was wet , shoes never slipped , and feet stayed dry. Now that the feet are taking care of need to find out why my swing is so bad..... Aloha

These are fantastic shoes. I wear them all the time, not just for golf. I usually wear a 11.5 but 12 was the right size in these for me. You may want to order a half size larger

These shoes run about a half size bigger than Footjoy and Etonic so be aware. With that said, they look great and are by far the most comfortable golf shoe I’ve ever put my foot in.

Nice looking golf shoe. A little tighter than comparable size in other brands.
"
14108,"
Shoes were very comfortable to walk 18 holes in. Water resistant unless you step in 2-3” of standing water! It was a good lightweight shoe to walk in and did not need a break in period. 10 1/2 ran true to size.
"
14109,"
The seams connecting the toe cap and upper shoe were so large they would fold over when you put the shoe on. It was like walking with a stick in the shoe.
"
14110,"
Fits small. There is stitching on the inside of one shoe that applies pressure and friction to the outside of my foot. Gets very uncomfortable early on in the golf round.
"
14111,"
Nice grip to stabilize ur swing.. light and comfy... Look good as well
"
14112,"
Bought these golf shoes on a whim because my Nike golf shoes were starting to fall apart and let me tell you, I couldn't be happier with my decision! I was originally going to buy the (more expensive) PUMA Ignite NXT's, but decided to save myself $20+ and I think I made the right choice. The Grip Fusion Sport's are lightweight, comfortable, and look great. If they had a casual pair, I would wear these around all the time! Note: These do not have spikes, only ridges.
"

Live the comfort while wearing these shoes except for the side to side motion. They tend to slip off your feet if not tied super tight. I bought the 9.5 regular, not wide foot shoe. Super comfortable other than that one negative.

These shoes are very comfortable right out of the box.  No break-in required.  They're lightweight, grip well and the mesh tops provide excellent ventilation.  They're pretty much everything you want in a golf shoe but I'm not sure how well the mesh tops would work in wet areas (I live and golf in Las Vegas so I rarely have to deal with wet conditions). You could spend a lot more on golf shoes but they won't be better than these!

Really good shoe as I am a golf instructor so I am on my feet a lot primarily indoors, and they are very comfortable! Not sure if it’s just cause it’s my feet but they do start to smell a little bit, but I will be getting another pair and recommend anybody do the same if they want comfort in a sleek looking shoe!

It must be something with the material used on the soles of the shoes. All the other features of the shoe are fine. But any time I wore these on a smooth surface, i.e. at a restaurant with tile floors or in a public restroom the shoes could not stop my feet from sliding around on the floor. Nearly ended up in a split once. It bothered me so much that I went back to my Nikes. Unfortunately I found all this out too late and could not return them.

Super comfortable, feel like slippers on your feet, and plenty of traction.... However, BEWARE the claim of waterproof, they are not even close.

Only wear these if it’s dry as a desert out on your course.

Read the reviews!  The constant complaint about the stitching around the toe cap is valid. The second I put these on I could feel the stitching running on my toes and the top of my foot.

These shoes are inexpensive and nice looking, but they are very uncomfortable.

Zero support and they have some badly designed straps or fabric inside of the shoe that rubbed your foot and make them extremely uncomfortable. The shoe also stretches and has already lost its form making you have to tie them harder and harder. Worst buy ever.

I should have listened to the other reviewers that talked about the inseam inside the outer part of the shoe.

The shoe has some issues in the interior where the tongue meets the lining. it’s very uncomfortable. Someone said in the reviews “once he put ductape on the area they where comfortable”.

Having had trouble with plantar fasciitis, I've found these shoes very comfortable in the few weeks I've owned them; walking the course is much more fun. I bought a 1/2 size larger so that I can use a better orthotic. I'm very pleased with the product.
"

Pros: The shoe looks great and fit true.Cons: The seam on the inside of the shoe where the gray and blue fabrics meet is poorly sewn and leaves a rough edge that rubs against the both sides of the foot.

"
14333,"
I really wanted to love these shoes. They are a nice change from the bland and boring shoes commonly found in golf. Stylish and lightweight, they were exactly what I was looking for. However, the construction of the shoe was a major deal breaker for me. Inside the shoe there is a seam that connects the upper with the lacing system. The exposed seam runs across the top part of the ball of your foot and is very uncomfortable when walking. If they were to add a second layer of fabric to cover this seam, it would be no issue.
"
14334,"
They look good but I like to play without socks and they ate my heels alive.
"
14335,"
The seam inside the shoe where the toe meets the upper folds over when you put your foot in, causing it to rub. I would imagine that would cause issues after the first few holes. Returning.
"

Can I rate it zero stars? The inside seam rubs against your little toe and the side of the foot. Extremely annoying and uncomfortable. Buy last years model instead. These are terrible.
"
14337,"
I've worn them all on the course and these are the absolute best. Tread just where you want for perfect pivot and amazing grip when you need it. I've worn Terrex, Merrill etc etc and these shoes outperform them all. They are semi waterproof but some scotch guard will help that.  They are not as durable as some of the more expensive shoes but they work better and for the price you can buy 2 or 3 pair for the same as some of the others.Excellent item!
"
14338,"
I never buy shoes online as I worry about the fit. However, this Puma gold shoe has changed my mind. It fits like a glove, is lightweight, and the sole provides great stability on the course.I took these from the box to the course and it was as if I had worn them forever! These are not water resistant so I don't plan to wear them in the rain or early mornings.Definitely a great shoe at a great price.

At first I did not like the shoes. There were two hard pieces near the front third (near the base of the toes) that cut into my foot.

I've been looking for the ""non aggressive"" style of golf shoe for a while.  What I mean by that is the bottom of the shoes don't lock your feet to the ground while you swing.  I've played a few rounds with them and absolutely love them.  Everyone I've golfed with was impressed with the look and even more so when I told them the price.  I'm not a daily or weekly golfer, so I can't speak to anyone who plays all the time.  As someone who plays a handful or rounds a year, I'm impressed with the comfort of them.  It really does feel like you're wearing a comfy pair of tennis shoes.
"
14426,"

"
14427,"
Overall its a great shoe. My only thing to note as a negative is that there's a seam towards the end of the shoe inside (hits just beneath your toes) that is very awkwardly placed. Was quite uncomfortable at first, but about 25min walking around in them i didn't notice it anymore. Just something to consider if purchasing; once broken in a little bit it mostly went way, but may not be worth the risk if you can find a better deal on another pair. I got these super on sale, so for me it was totally worth it.
"
14428,"
Just played my first round with these. Grip is great. Lightweight and fairly comfortable. The issues, insole is a little to be desired, but you can change that out. I did. As for the quality, it is “meh” to me. The stitching where the uppers meet the toe box dig into your outside-inside parts of your foot. Simple fix, throw some duck tape in there to tape back the stitching “lump” that is created when you slide these on. The support of the upper is ok, but if you generate a lot of torque or pressure on the outside of your left foot... be careful. The only really downside to this shoe is the stitching where the uppers meet the toe box. It is horrible and surprised that Puma let it go. Not an everyday golf show in my opinion, but for a weekend hack like me it will work fine. UPDATE: After three rounds in the eyelets are starting to separate from the fabric. IMO this is poor construction and quality. Still lightweight and comfortable, but the craftsmanship is horrible and why they would make the uppers with the mesh like fabric is beyond me. A solid composite upper would support better and withstand the use. Downgraded to 2 stars.

I bought the gray and yellow as well as the black and white pair. They are easy to get on, due to the lacing and tongue system are easy to loosen and tighten. They have a great wide toebox for added comfort. The Grip Fusion cleat system is legit. On the shortest of grass (and hard surface), I had great traction, no slipping whatsoever. I've had them for 3 weeks and have used them a lot and have little wear. They are so comfortable, I find myself wearing them the whole day even when I have errands to run after golf. Past golf shoes you can't wait to get them off. Highly recommend.

Bought these golf shoes on a whim because my Nike golf shoes were starting to fall apart and let me tell you, I couldn't be happier with my decision! I was originally going to buy the (more expensive) PUMA Ignite NXT's, but decided to save myself $20+ and I think I made the right choice.

These shoes are very comfortable right out of the box.  No break-in required.  They're lightweight, grip well and the mesh tops provide excellent ventilation.  They're pretty much everything you want in a golf shoe but I'm not sure how well the mesh tops would work in wet areas (I live and golf in Las Vegas so I rarely have to deal with wet conditions). You could spend a lot more on golf shoes but they won't be better than these!

It must be something with the material used on the soles of the shoes. All the other features of the shoe are fine. But any time I wore these on a smooth surface, i.e. at a restaurant with tile floors or in a public restroom the shoes could not stop my feet from sliding around on the floor. Nearly ended up in a split once. It bothered me so much that I went back to my Nikes. Unfortunately I found all this out too late and could not return them.

I've been a traditional golf shoe wearer for a long time.  I found these PUMA shoes to be comfortable, light and a bit cooler than traditional golf shoes.  They fit great and I'm glad that I bought them.

Extremely comfortable with no break-in necessary, first round as comfy as the 4th (4 so far).  Wife appreciates the everyday-shoe look.Haven't played in wet conditions yet.

Super comfortable, feel like slippers on your feet, and plenty of traction.... However, BEWARE the claim of waterproof, they are not even close. Walked an early morning 18, and just dew on the grass got them SOAKED. Had to buy new socks after 9 holes just for some semblance of a dry feeling on my feet. Only wear these if it’s dry as a desert out on your course.

"

Read the reviews!  The constant complaint about the stitching around the toe cap is valid. The second I put these on I could feel the stitching running on my toes and the top of my foot. I thought maybe that it would go away, so I walked on a treadmill for a little bit and the stitching was rubbing my feet raw. These shoes are inexpensive and nice looking, but they are very uncomfortable.
"

I would say these shoes run about a 1/2 size small. I wear a 10, and they were very snug across the top of the foot and in the toe. Had to get a 10 1/2 for them to be comfortable.

Having had trouble with plantar fasciitis, I've found these shoes very comfortable in the few weeks I've owned them; walking the course is much more fun. I bought a 1/2 size larger so that I can use a better orthotic. I'm very pleased with the product.

"
14667,"
I really wanted to love these shoes. They are a nice change from the bland and boring shoes commonly found in golf. Stylish and lightweight, they were exactly what I was looking for. However, the construction of the shoe was a major deal breaker for me. Inside the shoe there is a seam that connects the upper with the lacing system. The exposed seam runs across the top part of the ball of your foot and is very uncomfortable when walking. If they were to add a second layer of fabric to cover this seam, it would be no issue.
"
14668,"
They look good but I like to play without socks and they ate my heels alive.
"

The seam inside the shoe where the toe meets the upper folds over when you put your foot in, causing it to rub. I would imagine that would cause issues after the first few holes. Returning.
"

Can I rate it zero stars? The inside seam rubs against your little toe and the side of the foot. Extremely annoying and uncomfortable. Buy last years model instead. These are terrible.
"

I've worn them all on the course and these are the absolute best. Tread just where you want for perfect pivot and amazing grip when you need it. I've worn Terrex, Merrill etc etc and these shoes outperform them all. They are semi waterproof but some scotch guard will help that.  They are not as durable as some of the more expensive shoes but they work better and for the price you can buy 2 or 3 pair for the same as some of the others.Excellent item!
"
14672,"
I never buy shoes online as I worry about the fit. However, this Puma gold shoe has changed my mind. It fits like a glove, is lightweight, and the sole provides great stability on the course.I took these from the box to the course and it was as if I had worn them forever! These are not water resistant so I don't plan to wear them in the rain or early mornings.Definitely a great shoe at a great price.

These are good shoes. Puma makes a great golf shoe. But if you are looking for comfort and durability these are bit too plasticky.  For the price they are not unreasonable but for the daily golfer this shoe would not hold up.  My husband golfs 6 days a week. He has a variety of shoes by Ecco and GFore and Nike... I have a pair of Puma women's so thought he might like these too. These are probably waterproof but not as durable as the other brands. We returned them after a few days after purchases.  Comfortable but not for a long term every day golfer.  However, if you golf on occassion  these could be a perfect shoe. If you golf once a month or less they could be a perfect show for you.  Fit was true to size.

1/24/2022 - Update.  Amazon was not helpful with warranty but Puma was great.  I called their customer service line using the number on their official website and was taken care of right away.  They are sending me a new pair of shoes to support the waterproof warranty.  It's going to take a few days to get but I'm very happy with that.I really like the fit and feel of these shoes.  My rating comes from the fact that they are not waterproof and the warranty is crappy.  I just used them for the first time in a wet situation and both of my feet were wet in the toe area.  They are water resistant at best.  I guess I need to buy a pair of shoes and spray them with a hose before the warranty runs out.  Anyway, I'm going to order a different brand of shoes to replace as I need waterproof protection. I see in a comment that they have a 1 year waterproof warranty but there is no place on Amazon to ask for assistance.  You may have better luck buying them locally.

First, love the shoe. Stable even when swinging hard. Cleats hold even when the grass is a bit wet or I'm hitting out of sand (I've had other spikeless golf shoes that weren't so good). Were comfortable even on the first round - after three or four rounds now of breaking them in they are extremely comfortable - I need this, as I walk whenever I can.But ... I did read the reviews and Puma's suggestion before buying, and bought a 9.5 instead of my normal 10. Even that was too large. Returned them got a pair of 9s, which fit perfectly. Felt kind of weird to order a full size lower than usual, but other than that these are just really good shoes.Yes, you can certainly get much cheaper shoes. But if you walk? The basic average golf course is 6800 - 7,000 yards (about 4 miles) on the scorecard. The actual average walking distance is 6.6 miles - people have done studies ... you don't walk a course as the crow flies (you walk back and forth across fairways, etc., etc.). Walking over 6 and a half miles twice a weekend in cheap shoes is not very good for the feet. Or knees. Or back. These shoes are on the expensive end of the spectrum, but IMO are well worth it.

I have a couple pairs of Puma sneaker style golf shoes that I like because they are light, breathable, and very comfortable.  Took the advice of others from their reviews and ordered a pair a half size smaller then what I normally wear.  Good advice.  Glad I also ordered a wide width, too.  These fit well and are comfortable.  Very nice looking shoe.  They provide better lateral support then my other Pumas.
"

These are really solid shoes… the waterproofing holds up well and they are very sturdy. One small issue in they come up high on one of my ankles, so I did need to wear a sock that covers my ankles and actually took a bit of time to break in. Well worth it though! These will definitely last a few seasons and I will buy again.

I was looking for a golf shoe that looks good is waterproof, comfortable and not super expensive.I received yesterday and wore around house for a couple of hours to make sure they fit properly and no issues noted.I played 18 holes today and also wore them for a few hours post round as we went to a restaurant for a post game gathering.All I can say is that they are very comfortable with lots of cushioning and no gradual breaking in is required.
"
14776,"
Received today, and the fit is perfect!  I wear an 11.5” in Nike.  I followed the reviews to order ½” smaller, so obviously ordered 11.  Been wearing them around the house for a couple hours and the fit is absolutely perfect.  I am 6,1, 265 bodybuilder, and my feet aren’t wide or narrow; normal, it that’s a thing.  Anyway, I can’t comment about use on the links, or durability.
"
14777,"
I purchased the white/gray shoes a half-size down because of all the suggestions to go a half or full size smaller than your normal shoe size. They were still too long and fit very tightly in the middle of my foot. When I would swing, I would feel all of the tightness in my left shoe (right-handed golfer). It wasn’t necessarily uncomfortable, but I’d prefer to not notice any feeling in my shoes when I swing. I returned those and ordered another half-size smaller, but in the wide version, in hopes that the tightness in the middle of the shoe would be alleviated. I received the correct size, but not the wide version and not even the correct shoe color. They’re obviously still very snug because I didn’t receive the wide size. I’m not going to buy and try these a third time. Love the look, but not the feel. I wish I would’ve gotten the right shoe delivered the second time so I could speak to the difference between the wide and regular sizes. My recommendation is to order a full size smaller than your normal shoe size.

I did a search for golf shoes with the best arch support, and these were rated #2.  I've been fighting plantar fasciitis.

I was limping before I finished the ninth hole.

Someone mentioned about ordering it 1/2 or 1 full size smaller. Took that recommendation and ordered a 1/2 size smaller and it fits perfect on my feet.The shoe hugs all over your feet making you feel more controlled over how and where you want to step.I personally wouldn't recommend this shoe if you are flat footed because the shoe hugs over your arch like some Pumas or Adidas sneakers (Those who know would know).

I really like these shoes. They are very comfortable and I would recommend them. My only complaint is that they are half size too big. I wear size 11 and ordered an 11 in this shoe. When I received them they were too big. I put them up against my other Puma shoe size 11 and these shoes were noticeably larger. If you decide to get these shoes please take my word and order half size smaller! Otherwise great shoe!

I like these shoes. They’re comfy, and they look sharp. Hopefully the lacing system holds up.They wear slightly bigger for a size 10 than I thought they would. I wear a size 11 Adidas cross-trainer, size 10.5 Vans, and size 10.5 Columbia hiking boots. I read through some reviews, and people who had bought them said to buy a half-size smaller that you normally wear, so I bought size 10. I should have got size 9.5. I’m not expecting it to be too much of an issue though.

J'adore ces souliers ! Très confortable et vraiment design aussi.J'ai pris les 13 WIDE ayant des pieds très plats. La taille en longueur est un peu longue pour ma pointure habituelle, mais la largeur Wide est parfaite pour ceux qui ont des pieds très larges. J'ai eu de gros problèmes d'ampoules dans le passé du à des souliers trop étroit donc je suis très content de mon achat qui a réglé ce problème !Puisqu'ils sont neufs je n'ai pas pu tester leur durabilité ni le waterproof. Quand je vais jouer une partie de golf à la pluie je vais mettre à jours ce commentaire, mais Puma garantie le water proof pour une année.Livraison très rapide de Amazon. Je recommande fortement.

These are good shoes. Puma makes a great golf shoe. But if you are looking for comfort and durability these are bit too plasticky.  For the price they are not unreasonable but for the daily golfer this shoe would not hold up.  My husband golfs 6 days a week. He has a variety of shoes by Ecco and GFore and Nike... I have a pair of Puma women's so thought he might like these too. These are probably waterproof but not as durable as the other brands. We returned them after a few days after purchases.  Comfortable but not for a long term every day golfer.  However, if you golf on occassion  these could be a perfect shoe. If you golf once a month or less they could be a perfect show for you.  Fit was true to size.

1/24/2022 - Update.  Amazon was not helpful with warranty but Puma was great.  I called their customer service line using the number on their official website and was taken care of right away.  They are sending me a new pair of shoes to support the waterproof warranty.  It's going to take a few days to get but I'm very happy with that.I really like the fit and feel of these shoes.  My rating comes from the fact that they are not waterproof and the warranty is crappy.  I just used them for the first time in a wet situation and both of my feet were wet in the toe area.  They are water resistant at best.  I guess I need to buy a pair of shoes and spray them with a hose before the warranty runs out.  Anyway, I'm going to order a different brand of shoes to replace as I need waterproof protection. I see in a comment that they have a 1 year waterproof warranty but there is no place on Amazon to ask for assistance.  You may have better luck buying them locally.

First, love the shoe. Stable even when swinging hard. Cleats hold even when the grass is a bit wet or I'm hitting out of sand (I've had other spikeless golf shoes that weren't so good). Were comfortable even on the first round - after three or four rounds now of breaking them in they are extremely comfortable - I need this, as I walk whenever I can.But ... I did read the reviews and Puma's suggestion before buying, and bought a 9.5 instead of my normal 10. Even that was too large. Returned them got a pair of 9s, which fit perfectly. Felt kind of weird to order a full size lower than usual, but other than that these are just really good shoes.Yes, you can certainly get much cheaper shoes. But if you walk? The basic average golf course is 6800 - 7,000 yards (about 4 miles) on the scorecard. The actual average walking distance is 6.6 miles - people have done studies ... you don't walk a course as the crow flies (you walk back and forth across fairways, etc., etc.). Walking over 6 and a half miles twice a weekend in cheap shoes is not very good for the feet. Or knees. Or back. These shoes are on the expensive end of the spectrum, but IMO are well worth it.

I have a couple pairs of Puma sneaker style golf shoes that I like because they are light, breathable, and very comfortable.  Took the advice of others from their reviews and ordered a pair a half size smaller then what I normally wear.  Good advice.  Glad I also ordered a wide width, too.  These fit well and are comfortable.  Very nice looking shoe.  They provide better lateral support then my other Pumas.
"

These are really solid shoes… the waterproofing holds up well and they are very sturdy. One small issue in they come up high on one of my ankles, so I did need to wear a sock that covers my ankles and actually took a bit of time to break in. Well worth it though! These will definitely last a few seasons and I will buy again.

I was looking for a golf shoe that looks good is waterproof, comfortable and not super expensive.I received yesterday and wore around house for a couple of hours to make sure they fit properly and no issues noted.I played 18 holes today and also wore them for a few hours post round as we went to a restaurant for a post game gathering.All I can say is that they are very comfortable with lots of cushioning and no gradual breaking in is required.
"

Received today, and the fit is perfect!  I wear an 11.5” in Nike.  I followed the reviews to order ½” smaller, so obviously ordered 11.  Been wearing them around the house for a couple hours and the fit is absolutely perfect.  I am 6,1, 265 bodybuilder, and my feet aren’t wide or narrow; normal, it that’s a thing.  Anyway, I can’t comment about use on the links, or durability.
"
14954,"
I purchased the white/gray shoes a half-size down because of all the suggestions to go a half or full size smaller than your normal shoe size. They were still too long and fit very tightly in the middle of my foot. When I would swing, I would feel all of the tightness in my left shoe (right-handed golfer). It wasn’t necessarily uncomfortable, but I’d prefer to not notice any feeling in my shoes when I swing. I returned those and ordered another half-size smaller, but in the wide version, in hopes that the tightness in the middle of the shoe would be alleviated. I received the correct size, but not the wide version and not even the correct shoe color. They’re obviously still very snug because I didn’t receive the wide size. I’m not going to buy and try these a third time. Love the look, but not the feel. I wish I would’ve gotten the right shoe delivered the second time so I could speak to the difference between the wide and regular sizes. My recommendation is to order a full size smaller than your normal shoe size.

Someone mentioned about ordering it 1/2 or 1 full size smaller.

I really like these shoes. They are very comfortable and I would recommend them. My only complaint is that they are half size too big. I wear size 11 and ordered an 11 in this shoe. When I received them they were too big. I put them up against my other Puma shoe size 11 and these shoes were noticeably larger. If you decide to get these shoes please take my word and order half size smaller! Otherwise great shoe!

"

I like these shoes. They’re comfy, and they look sharp. Hopefully the lacing system holds up.They wear slightly bigger for a size 10 than I thought they would. I wear a size 11 Adidas cross-trainer, size 10.5 Vans, and size 10.5 Columbia hiking boots. I read through some reviews, and people who had bought them said to buy a half-size smaller that you normally wear, so I bought size 10. I should have got size 9.5. I’m not expecting it to be too much of an issue though.

J'adore ces souliers ! Très confortable et vraiment design aussi.J'ai pris les 13 WIDE ayant des pieds très plats. La taille en longueur est un peu longue pour ma pointure habituelle, mais la largeur Wide est parfaite pour ceux qui ont des pieds très larges. J'ai eu de gros problèmes d'ampoules dans le passé du à des souliers trop étroit donc je suis très content de mon achat qui a réglé ce problème !Puisqu'ils sont neufs je n'ai pas pu tester leur durabilité ni le waterproof. Quand je vais jouer une partie de golf à la pluie je vais mettre à jours ce commentaire, mais Puma garantie le water proof pour une année.Livraison très rapide de Amazon. Je recommande fortement.

I bought these for my husband who has been wearing the same golf shoes for 15 years and loved them.  We had tried other shoes and they just didn't have the comfort he was looking for.  I took a chance on these and he is really happy with them.  I ordered the wide fit and he tells me they fit like a glove and the Fasten8 functionality provides great support as well.  Very happy that he is very happy.

What your reading this for: The shoes are awesome. They fit pretty true to size (although I got a 12 just to be safe I could have squeaked by with 11.5 but the extra room is nice imo). The detail is sharp, the shoes seem well made, ( I went through 3 pairs of ""Indestructables Shoes (their brand name and claim) and they fell apart  quickly), and the insole feels heavenly. Super thick and soft memory foam. I spend at least 8 hours a day on my feet at work and will update this if they start to lose their softness and support.I love these shoes. I wouldn't hesitate to buy them or Puma again. (Again if this changes or they fall apart I will update this review)Now the slightly annoying things with this order. First the shipping was horrible. Almost over 2 weeks from order to get here. In comparison the rest of my order arrived in 2 days. Did they make the shoes to order? And my box. I like to keep my shoe boxes to store them in. I guess someone has a grudge and roughed my box up pretty bad. Not pleased.If I was pretty I would be complaining because we know the best place for your shoes between wears is in their box. (Say what you want but I like to keep my shoes in nice condition. Dress the part - you gonna wear dirty shoes and a wrinkled t shirt?) I assume the delivery company had a hand in roughing it up.TL:DR - Shoes are awesome, fit well, and comfy. Box came damaged and shipping time was disgustingly long.

Bought a pair in a men’s 11 to replace another similar pair of white pumas I have. The left shoe felt like it was a size 10. It was significantly tighter and uncomfortable. It felt like the toe had exposed leather stitching inside and was much smaller than the right shoe. I’m a bit suspicious of how authentic these were. The red puma box was pretty beat up as well. Ultimately had to return these and bought a pair of adidas supserstars directly from their website.

I am not a fan of just rubber sole, no midsole unless its a clyde or suede. This is faux leather no added midsole- just a soft foam liner which i dont like. Its red box meaning in puma the green boxes have imeva midsoles for example. Not my cup of tea. These are true to size and a cheaper option

The shoes looked nice, though the box got ripped during shipping. The soles felt comfy but the toe box put pressure on all sides of my foot.

What your reading this for: The shoes are awesome. They fit pretty true to size (although I got a 12 just to be safe I could have squeaked by with 11.5 but the extra room is nice imo). The detail is sharp, the shoes seem well made, ( I went through 3 pairs of ""Indestructables Shoes (their brand name and claim) and they fell apart  quickly), and the insole feels heavenly. Super thick and soft memory foam. I spend at least 8 hours a day on my feet at work and will update this if they start to lose their softness and support.I love these shoes. I wouldn't hesitate to buy them or Puma again. (Again if this changes or they fall apart I will update this review)Now the slightly annoying things with this order. First the shipping was horrible. Almost over 2 weeks from order to get here. In comparison the rest of my order arrived in 2 days. Did they make the shoes to order? And my box. I like to keep my shoe boxes to store them in. I guess someone has a grudge and roughed my box up pretty bad. Not pleased.If I was pretty I would be complaining because we know the best place for your shoes between wears is in their box. (Say what you want but I like to keep my shoes in nice condition. Dress the part - you gonna wear dirty shoes and a wrinkled t shirt?) I assume the delivery company had a hand in roughing it up.TL:DR - Shoes are awesome, fit well, and comfy. Box came damaged and shipping time was disgustingly long.

For starters, I reordered this item because the size was too small even though I've ordered that size before.

Great shoes, good look, great for the price. Just run a bit small. Did end up adding insoles to all my shoes, including these. Unsurprisingly, they don't come standard with great support.
"
15445,"
A tiny bit narrow, and the toe cap is short. As the leather breaks in, the spot where the shoe folds often presses against the top of my toes in an uncomfortable way that other shoes do not. Very attractive shoes, though, and high quality material.
"

These are not what I was expecting. I thought ""suede"", but I guess I misread. Love the color. Moderate support. Neither too wide nor too narrow.  They are kind of stiff rather than supple, but I'm thinking there will be some break-in. These look good with anything. Really good. I like them just for that, but these will go to the gym for a tryout.

The shoes didn't come in the original box. They are 10.5 but the sole insert says 9.5. I ordered a half size up and they are still a bit tighter than I like for a shoe. After a day of wear, I didn't notice the tightness as much...its just a tad tight. Over all,  I like the shoes, would buy different color if it weren't for the collection of puma suede ive amassed. All in all. Expect them to be snug but a good shoe
"
15450,"
For starters, I reordered this item because the size was too small even though I've ordered that size before. Unfortunately the person I ordered them for assumed that when we got the ""larger size"" that it would work and we just discovered (when getting dressed for an event) that the re-ordered shoes were actually ""smaller"" than the original ones we ordered. Also, the sticker label inside the shoe showed it was a 10.5 and the lining inside the shoe showed it was an 11.5.  What the heck?  Our fault for assuming that the reorder would work, but I will not be ordering this shoe again.

Holy wow, never have I seen an insole shaped like this.  I think they might actually have negative arch support, less than zero.  They feel exactly like a pair of Chuck Taylors, but with less toe room.  With the soles out, there's plenty of wiggle room for the piggies, but I mean look how thick these things are in the front!  What... in.... the actual... Well instead of returning, I ordered some new insoles.  Def wouldn't run or play sports in these shoes, I bought em for fashion.  They're just cheap Chinese sweat shop shoes.  I like how they look though, so for my purposes they'll be fine once I can actually wear them.

The shoe is stiff enough that toes don't go numb on long rides, the outsole is durable enough that they don't get chewed up by the pins on flat pedals, the short lugged tread design really finds and hooks into pins on pedals, and the lack of breathability in the upper keeps feet warm and relatively dry.  These and the Tazon 6 are what I wear and they're a lot less expensive than cycling-specific shoes for flat pedals, and have all the things that make those kinds of shoes great.

Bought these for my 12 year old son. He absolutely loves them with one tiny exception. The laces are not ""too short"" but they could definitely have a little extra length for a better fit to the shoe. Not the biggest issue, I bought replacement laces and he is very satisfied. Now the real question is which will happen first; him out growing them or them wearing out?

They fit great and offer support even for a big guy but the toe box is to small in the larger size I ordered the 13 so the big toe area is tight and after extended ware the can cause discomfort. But overall great support I'm in the super heavyweight class and they put up with me.

I was surprised to see a Puma running shoe, as I'd seen this billed, for this price. It looked more like a cross-trainer to me, and I had need of a more solid shoe in the gym (I've been wearing very flexible and light sailing shoes.) If it had been a good running shoe as well, I'd have made out like a bandit.Well, I don't think many would like it as a running shoe. It's fairly heavy, clunky, not so flexible, and I think would not be efficient for running.I like it for weightlifting, however, so I definitely got my money's worth.Construction seems good. Of course it is not leather, and is a little cheap looking but not badly so at all.I saw different prices for different sizes and got one of the good prices. I couldn't recommend it at the higher prices, hence the 3 stars. If considering the price I paid, it would have deserved four stars IMO.

they started to fall apart about a month after i got them, , by the 3rd month the toe came unglued from the sole and i quit wearing them , i really liked them they look good super comfortable and were priced lower then other comparable shoes they just need to toughen them up,

"

Okay
"
15685,"
The shoe fits pretty well, but the very back is a little bit low on the heel for my personal taste. It's been comfy but there's no memory foam or anything like that, it's not particularly ""floaty"" feeling. I only paid like $40 for them though, and for that they're a great deal. They even protected my feet from water perfectly, the whole front of the shoe seems to be waterproof. Laces seem to be good quality and they have decent grip too. Good for casual shoes, I don't know if I'd recommend them for running on hard surfaces.
"

I have been wearing Puma tazon or levitate shoes since 2012. In my job I walk 10-25k steps a day and before finding Pumas nothing helped my feet.. Note that these shoes last mr about 6 months with my usage. The soles are soft and grip well but wear faster than other brands. The usually around the 6 month mark the sole will start to detach from the leather. I tried to switch to another 140$ brand just one time(rhymes with shmooks) thought they were good quality, my arches were in pain all the time. So Puma it will be for a while..

I like the look and feel of these sneakers.  One word of caution, if you live in a cold climate where there's lots of snow and ice on the ground, these sneakers don't have a lot of grip on the soles.  Other than that, they're great.

Terrible son una replica no son originales, las costuras terribles, la suela casi despegada para nada estoy satisfecha con el producto; lamentablemente no puedo hacer la devolución porque soy de Ecuador y debo gastar en hacer el envío para arriesgarme que me den otros de los mismos.

It’s a good feel to my feet especially when driving that’s the reason why I bought it

The all around fit of the shoe was above average. They are very light and great for walking and when you want that casual look. Of course,  I got black since it goes with everything. I would definitely buy them again.

Poor workmanship, very uncomfortable to walk in. I wouldn't recommend these shoes.
"

had to get shoes for my long daily dog walking and wanted something more substantial then the knit ones so popular now. these are black to hide dirt, light and comfortable, stay tied (a problem with some shoes) and tough enough for kicking the ball around with my dog. a short break in and they were flexible enough. i will see how long they last for the final verdict but am happy nowUPDATE SEPT 2022: well they lasted 2 years of daily dog walk mileage. Probably could have tossed them sooner but impressed how the sole and toe box lasted.
"
15698,"
Super stylish but not very much support at all, sole is super thin so I had to buy big thick insoles or I get foot fatigue bad. Now they have started to squeak every time I take a step.  I expected more from Puma. All in all not the best shoe I’ve ever owned.

A very beautiful pair of shoes. Unfortunately they are a little too tight and a little too narrow than other shoes. I wear them anyway and what I do after a few hours my feet are paying for the bad decision. But, everyone's feet are different.  If they fit your feet right? You will love these shoes!

There is everything to like about these sneakers, e.g. there is no break-in period, you put them on and they mold and cushion your feet, and you literally feel as if you're walking on cushions of air, levitating.  I have worn Pumas for well over 45 yrs. as my athletic and daily footwear, and with each year it seems as if it is always a step ahead of all others in their design and excellence.  Thank you and keep up the good work.

I bought these for my husband. I always buy half a size larger because he wears double socks in winter. No clue why they don't slip now that it's warm. My biggest beef, these are NOT leather. Leather needs to be removed from the description. You can always smell leather, and you can always smell vinyl. Or the lack thereof of any smell. I bought these because they're listed as leather, and in the questions, it's asked if these are leather. These aren't leather. My husband kept them because he wears them for work and his others blew out. These won't last because of the vinyl.

I should have known better than to overlook the number of reviews which clearly stated that these were not real leather.  It's the very first time that I've been swindled by anyone on Amazon - this is my own fault for being so trusting.I've had these for a few months and wear them periodically, so it took some time to notice and the return window has long passed.  BUT, I JUST TOOK THE TIME TO DO THIS TO SAVE SOMEONE ELSE.

Tried for weeks to break them and they have gotten worse. There’s a reason these are cheaper than most other puma shoes. The fit is awful, they hurt my low arch and leave giant blisters on my ankles after less than a mile of walking. These shoes are terrible.

Amazon advertised as primarily leather with synthetics. Upon receiving, the inside tag says all synthetic. False advertising.They fit well and I'm going to give synthetic a try which will hopefully hold up to daily use. My old leather Nike's lasted a couple years. These Puma's are nice.

Standard are way to small in the width. Unisex may be the concern.

PLasticky material no protection for the toes. Good waterproofing but no holes for the heat from your feet. Had to remove the inserts to ease the pressure cooking. The inserts are excellent cushioning best I`ve experienced in decades I use them in my other footwear, other than that it`s more value for money.

I bought five pairs of the shoes.  :-(Not one pair lasted over two months.What was supposed to be leather, ended up PEELING OFF and underneath looked like the lining of a carpet.EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY!!!This is not the first pair that I purchased of puma's BUT it is the first pair that I purchased the has reacted this way.Obviously just poor material, poor workmanship and a defective cheap products.DO NOT BUY! YOU WILL REGRET IT.CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP...Another thing that's regretful, is Amazon and it's promotion of this specific shoe. That was the one reason why I purchased it. If you can't trust Amazon who can you trust? I mean it specifically, it's coming from and a product of Amazon. It's not a third party product.IT IS CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP I CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH SO CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-(

While I do not have wide feet, they are not narrow. These shoes are cut very narrow and we’re very tight on me. I had to return them.Also, it is worth noting that the outer material is very stiff and will crease once you wear them regularly.It’s an attractive shoe, but a poor construction.

My husband has a bit of a wide foot so this sneaker didn’t actually fit him but he loved that it didn’t have any of the usual mesh fabric that most sneakers do.

A pesar de que la suela del tenis parece fragil y sin resistencia, no lo es, de hecho me sorprende la resistencia y flexibilidad que trae dicha suela, sumado que el desgaste no es considerable y sigue resistiendo y el antiderrape lo sigue teniendo, esto a 4 meses de comprarlos, claro si hablamos que la exigencia al tenis que lo he expuesto es de una exigencia normal y no a una mayor como la de los tenis de los deportistas de alto rendimiento, también la piel se ha comportado a la altura, que aunque es vinipiel, se ha mantenido resistente, humectada y sin perder brillo, dando el toque final es que se calzan como si de guantes se tratara, dotándolos de una gran comodidad, que creo que fácilmente pueden mantenerse así por un año más.

Cuando vi el diseño, la marca y el precio, no me quedó duda, tengo que comprarlos. Es un diseño muy atractivo, hechos por un fabricante de prestigio y a un precio poco visto en zapatos deportivos.Lo bueno:Son hermosos, tengo 3 días con ellos y me los han chuleado como 10 veces.Precio, son muy accesibles y lucen como si costaran el doble.Rendimiento deportivo, se ajustan firmemente y su suela brinda excelente soporte en talón y arco.Pisada cómoda, muy buena amortiguación.Lo malo:El ""cuero sintético"" (por no decir plástico) se siente muy débil, tengo un constante temor por romperlo.Son para uso deportivo, por lo que se sienten ajustados, incluso ""duermen"" el pié si se usan en reposo por periodos prolongados.El patrón de la suela está cuidadosamente diseñado para atrapar pequeñas piedras, no es problema en el gimnasio pero es algo a considerar si los piensas usar para correr.En conclusión, me gusta como se ven y estoy satisfecho, pero tengo la impresión que no me van a durar, si existiera una versión de piel genuina, con gusto pagaría el doble.

First, I was sent two RIGHT shoes. Yes, two shoes for the same foot and I had to send them back, so there's that. Anyway, this is a nice looking shoe that fits true to size, however the upper seemed to be made of such a light, cheap looking synthetic material, I would have sent them back anyway. They are only $60 but still, they didn't look at all durable to me. If they'd been leather uppers and I was sent both a right AND a left shoe, I would have loved these.

A pesar de no haber cumplido con la fecha de entrega estipulada, le doy las 5 estrellas, también porque al hacer el cambio de fecha me rebajaron otros $12 pesos, aun cuando el producto tenia un precio muy bajo. En cuanto a la calidad no hay nada mas que decir, puesto que la marca es mas que reconocida por hacer productos de calidad, es un modelo muy sencillo hay que reconocer, pero el precio me pareció mas que atractivo ($677.81).Definitivamente volvería a comprar este modelo por lo cómodo que es.

Me encantaron, son los primeros puma que compro, diseño, comodidad, numero exacto, son amplios al frente, no se siente el arco y al menos para mi no me afecta. Son sinteticos, pero en estos años ya casi todos son asi. Ya veremos que tanto dura el material. La suela es algo delgada, lo compensan con una plantilla EVA bastante comoda. Son hechos en Vietnam y los acabados son buenos. Ya actualizare despues de unos meses.

Holy wow, never have I seen an insole shaped like this.  I think they might actually have negative arch support, less than zero.  They feel exactly like a pair of Chuck Taylors, but with less toe room.  With the soles out, there's plenty of wiggle room for the piggies, but I mean look how thick these things are in the front!  What... in.... the actual... Well instead of returning, I ordered some new insoles.  Def wouldn't run or play sports in these shoes, I bought em for fashion.  They're just cheap Chinese sweat shop shoes.  I like how they look though, so for my purposes they'll be fine once I can actually wear them.
"
16622,"
The shoe is stiff enough that toes don't go numb on long rides, the outsole is durable enough that they don't get chewed up by the pins on flat pedals, the short lugged tread design really finds and hooks into pins on pedals, and the lack of breathability in the upper keeps feet warm and relatively dry.  These and the Tazon 6 are what I wear and they're a lot less expensive than cycling-specific shoes for flat pedals, and have all the things that make those kinds of shoes great.

16623,"

Bought these for my 12 year old son. He absolutely loves them with one tiny exception. The laces are not ""too short"" but they could definitely have a little extra length for a better fit to the shoe. Not the biggest issue, I bought replacement laces and he is very satisfied. Now the real question is which will happen first; him out growing them or them wearing out?

They fit great and offer support even for a big guy but the toe box is to small in the larger size I ordered the 13 so the big toe area is tight and after extended ware the can cause discomfort. But overall great support I'm in the super heavyweight class and they put up with me.

I was surprised to see a Puma running shoe, as I'd seen this billed, for this price. It looked more like a cross-trainer to me, and I had need of a more solid shoe in the gym (I've been wearing very flexible and light sailing shoes.) If it had been a good running shoe as well, I'd have made out like a bandit.Well, I don't think many would like it as a running shoe. It's fairly heavy, clunky, not so flexible, and I think would not be efficient for running.I like it for weightlifting, however, so I definitely got my money's worth.Construction seems good. Of course it is not leather, and is a little cheap looking but not badly so at all.I saw different prices for different sizes and got one of the good prices. I couldn't recommend it at the higher prices, hence the 3 stars. If considering the price I paid, it would have deserved four stars IMO.

they started to fall apart about a month after i got them, , by the 3rd month the toe came unglued from the sole and i quit wearing them , i really liked them they look good super comfortable and were priced lower then other comparable shoes they just need to toughen them up,

I always liked puma shoes. These shoes did not last me as long as my other ones the sole start separating and is thin
"
16639,"
Okay
"
16640,"
The shoe fits pretty well, but the very back is a little bit low on the heel for my personal taste. It's been comfy but there's no memory foam or anything like that, it's not particularly ""floaty"" feeling. I only paid like $40 for them though, and for that they're a great deal. They even protected my feet from water perfectly, the whole front of the shoe seems to be waterproof. Laces seem to be good quality and they have decent grip too. Good for casual shoes, I don't know if I'd recommend them for running on hard surfaces.
"
16641,"
I have been wearing Puma tazon or levitate shoes since 2012. In my job I walk 10-25k steps a day and before finding Pumas nothing helped my feet.. Note that these shoes last mr about 6 months with my usage. The soles are soft and grip well but wear faster than other brands. The usually around the 6 month mark the sole will start to detach from the leather. I tried to switch to another 140$ brand just one time(rhymes with shmooks) thought they were good quality, my arches were in pain all the time. So Puma it will be for a while..

I like the look and feel of these sneakers.  One word of caution, if you live in a cold climate where there's lots of snow and ice on the ground, these sneakers don't have a lot of grip on the soles.  Other than that, they're great.
"
16648,"
Terrible son una replica no son originales, las costuras terribles, la suela casi despegada para nada estoy satisfecha con el producto; lamentablemente no puedo hacer la devolución porque soy de Ecuador y debo gastar en hacer el envío para arriesgarme que me den otros de los mismos.

It’s a good feel to my feet especially when driving that’s the reason why I bought it

The all around fit of the shoe was above average. They are very light and great for walking and when you want that casual look. Of course,  I got black since it goes with everything. I would definitely buy them again.

16651,"
Poor workmanship, very uncomfortable to walk in. I wouldn't recommend these shoes.
"
16652,"
had to get shoes for my long daily dog walking and wanted something more substantial then the knit ones so popular now. these are black to hide dirt, light and comfortable, stay tied (a problem with some shoes) and tough enough for kicking the ball around with my dog. a short break in and they were flexible enough. i will see how long they last for the final verdict but am happy nowUPDATE SEPT 2022: well they lasted 2 years of daily dog walk mileage. Probably could have tossed them sooner but impressed how the sole and toe box lasted.
"
16653,"
Super stylish but not very much support at all, sole is super thin so I had to buy big thick insoles or I get foot fatigue bad. Now they have started to squeak every time I take a step.  I expected more from Puma. All in all not the best shoe I’ve ever owned.
"
16654,"

The fit was perfect. They lasted a while. My husband thinks they are comfortable and loves Pumas. Although he's moved to a different style Puma (more expensive). The price was right for these.  These were true Pumas not want to be's. Would definitely purchase again .
"
16656,"
A very beautiful pair of shoes. Unfortunately they are a little too tight and a little too narrow than other shoes. I wear them anyway and what I do after a few hours my feet are paying for the bad decision. But, everyone's feet are different.  If they fit your feet right? You will love these shoes!

Quality shoe. Outlasts Nike every time, best shoes I've ever owned. Been buying Puma for 30 years since any other shoe I try doesnt hold up.My kids wear Puma also as as other brands only last 4 to 6 months. Pumas last well over a year (5 teens in the house)
"

These shoes fit perfect, and are my favorite pair.  The fit, look, and feel are true to what is advertised.

Purchased for my husband who has been extremely happy with the look and fit of these sneakers. He finds them more comfortable than past purchases and tells me he would buy them again.  He tends to be highly critical when it comes to sneakers so these must be made very well.

I wanted a White Color and wide shoe but it was out of stock
"
16677,"
Fits perfectly for my feet (size 12), great comfort on toe arch area, classy look with my work scrubs and very comfortable for a long 12-13 hours works - 4 days a week.
"
16678,"
It fit okay but when I put them on it was like there was no arch. On the right of the right bottom they stick out the same goes for the left of the left sneaker. On the back of one of the sneakers I can see glue. Wondering if they will last long. The service and shipment wasn't bad. I will keep them and see how it works out.

Shoe is OK a little tight but other than that what's expected.

There is everything to like about these sneakers, e.g. there is no break-in period, you put them on and they mold and cushion your feet, and you literally feel as if you're walking on cushions of air, levitating.  I have worn Pumas for well over 45 yrs. as my athletic and daily footwear, and with each year it seems as if it is always a step ahead of all others in their design and excellence.  Thank you and keep up the good work.

When looking at the pictures these trainers look pretty. The pictures don't so them justice they are just amazing.

These shoes are crazy comfortable.  The padding under the ball of your feet feels like a pillow.  The rubber sole of the shoe looks thin, but the padding has to be close to an inch thick.  I've already looked for this shoe in other colors and will buy again when the tread eventually wears out.

Haven't bought new shoes in years, so these were a godsend. Nice and cushioned and great for when I need to crank out that sanic speed.

I have wide feet that tend to swell during the day.  I have an old pair of Pumas that fit me great but were starting to wear out, so I bought these to replace them.

I bought these for my husband. I always buy half a size larger because he wears double socks in winter. No clue why they don't slip now that it's warm. My biggest beef, these are NOT leather. Leather needs to be removed from the description. You can always smell leather, and you can always smell vinyl. Or the lack thereof of any smell. I bought these because they're listed as leather, and in the questions, it's asked if these are leather. These aren't leather. My husband kept them because he wears them for work and his others blew out. These won't last because of the vinyl.

Amazon advertised as primarily leather with synthetics. Upon receiving, the inside tag says all synthetic.

PLasticky material no protection for the toes. Good waterproofing but no holes for the heat from your feet. Had to remove the inserts to ease the pressure cooking. The inserts are excellent cushioning best I`ve experienced in decades I use them in my other footwear, other than that it`s more value for money.

I bought five pairs of the shoes.  :-(Not one pair lasted over two months.What was supposed to be leather, ended up PEELING OFF and underneath looked like the lining of a carpet.EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY!!!This is not the first pair that I purchased of puma's BUT it is the first pair that I purchased the has reacted this way.Obviously just poor material, poor workmanship and a defective cheap products.DO NOT BUY! YOU WILL REGRET IT.CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP...Another thing that's regretful, is Amazon and it's promotion of this specific shoe. That was the one reason why I purchased it. If you can't trust Amazon who can you trust? I mean it specifically, it's coming from and a product of Amazon. It's not a third party product.IT IS CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP I CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH SO CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-(

While I do not have wide feet, they are not narrow. These shoes are cut very narrow and we’re very tight on me. I had to return them.Also, it is worth noting that the outer material is very stiff and will crease once you wear them regularly.It’s an attractive shoe, but a poor construction.

Good solid walking sneaker/show. comfortable for all-day wear. good looking and easy to clean. They have a nice grip on wet surfaces and keep your posture stable. I plan to get another pair in a different color. Puma still has a good quality shoe today. which speaks volumes.

My husband has a bit of a wide foot so this sneaker didn’t actually fit him but he loved that it didn’t have any of the usual mesh fabric that most sneakers do. If this sneaker came in wide I lost likely would have ordered 2-3 pairs for him!!!! Well made, fabulous price, I wish they worked for his wider toe box.

A pesar de que la suela del tenis parece fragil y sin resistencia, no lo es, de hecho me sorprende la resistencia y flexibilidad que trae dicha suela, sumado que el desgaste no es considerable y sigue resistiendo y el antiderrape lo sigue teniendo, esto a 4 meses de comprarlos, claro si hablamos que la exigencia al tenis que lo he expuesto es de una exigencia normal y no a una mayor como la de los tenis de los deportistas de alto rendimiento, también la piel se ha comportado a la altura, que aunque es vinipiel, se ha mantenido resistente, humectada y sin perder brillo, dando el toque final es que se calzan como si de guantes se tratara, dotándolos de una gran comodidad, que creo que fácilmente pueden mantenerse así por un año más.
"
17133,"
Cuando vi el diseño, la marca y el precio, no me quedó duda, tengo que comprarlos. Es un diseño muy atractivo, hechos por un fabricante de prestigio y a un precio poco visto en zapatos deportivos.Lo bueno:Son hermosos, tengo 3 días con ellos y me los han chuleado como 10 veces.Precio, son muy accesibles y lucen como si costaran el doble.Rendimiento deportivo, se ajustan firmemente y su suela brinda excelente soporte en talón y arco.Pisada cómoda, muy buena amortiguación.Lo malo:El ""cuero sintético"" (por no decir plástico) se siente muy débil, tengo un constante temor por romperlo.Son para uso deportivo, por lo que se sienten ajustados, incluso ""duermen"" el pié si se usan en reposo por periodos prolongados.El patrón de la suela está cuidadosamente diseñado para atrapar pequeñas piedras, no es problema en el gimnasio pero es algo a considerar si los piensas usar para correr.En conclusión, me gusta como se ven y estoy satisfecho, pero tengo la impresión que no me van a durar, si existiera una versión de piel genuina, con gusto pagaría el doble.

First, I was sent two RIGHT shoes. Yes, two shoes for the same foot and I had to send them back, so there's that. Anyway, this is a nice looking shoe that fits true to size, however the upper seemed to be made of such a light, cheap looking synthetic material, I would have sent them back anyway. They are only $60 but still, they didn't look at all durable to me. If they'd been leather uppers and I was sent both a right AND a left shoe, I would have loved these.

A pesar de no haber cumplido con la fecha de entrega estipulada, le doy las 5 estrellas, también porque al hacer el cambio de fecha me rebajaron otros $12 pesos, aun cuando el producto tenia un precio muy bajo. En cuanto a la calidad no hay nada mas que decir, puesto que la marca es mas que reconocida por hacer productos de calidad, es un modelo muy sencillo hay que reconocer, pero el precio me pareció mas que atractivo ($677.81).Definitivamente volvería a comprar este modelo por lo cómodo que es.

Me encantaron, son los primeros puma que compro, diseño, comodidad, numero exacto, son amplios al frente, no se siente el arco y al menos para mi no me afecta. Son sinteticos, pero en estos años ya casi todos son asi. Ya veremos que tanto dura el material. La suela es algo delgada, lo compensan con una plantilla EVA bastante comoda. Son hechos en Vietnam y los acabados son buenos. Ya actualizare despues de unos meses.

Honestamente esperaba más de estos tenis. Son demasiado genéricos, parecen ser piratas: no son cómodos y el material es barato (piel no es). Al pisar se sienten los ""cuadritos"" de la suela, (tendré que ponerle unas plantillas).Decepción total de Puma.Recomiendo que mejor busquen otros porque para correr o para hacer ejercicio, no son.Son toscos así que tampoco se ven bonitos así como para andar nomás.

Este producto se lo compre a uno de mis hijos y la verdad todo excelente, siempre se batalla por el ancho y el tipo de arco pronunciado del pie y estos tenis cumplieron en todo.
"

Al mirar el modelo me gustó tanto que lo pedí inmediatamente, pero cuando llegó que tristeza sentí, los materiales no son de cuero o piel es simplemente plástico un tipo de Vinyl grueso que no es para nada cómodo, se siente duro y eso que el número que pedí me quedó bien, con el solo hecho de probarlos se desprendieron la marca de Puma en la plantilla, una lastima que una marca tan reconocida venda esto NO lo compren se van a decepcionar

Ordered a size 9.5 and only got a size 8.Very disappointed and when I tried to return the shoes I was told that I can’t because they’ve been worn. Yet I didn’t even have the chance to wear them, besides trying them “on”.Terrible product. Don’t buy unless you buy 1.5 sizes up, because they may give you the wrong size too.Waste of almost $100

This is my favorite pair of shoes now! Looks great and feels great! I’m definitely ordering these again when this wear out.
"
17571,"
I had heard some good and some bad regarding these shoes. The bad was that they may have not been authentic Puma athletic shoes.I can say that these are authentic Pumas as I received the shoe box. I have accidentally purchased knock-off shoes before.They fit well although I think that they are a bit loose around the ankle. I have beenPlaying with the shoe strings to get them tighter around the ankle.I really love the sleek look of the all-black and for the price that I paid ($55) you really can’t get a better cross-trainer style shoe that you can also wear out with jeans or slacks!

I’m confused by some of the bad reviews for these shoes. Seem well made and lookgood too. I got 12 Wide and they fit a little tight but will wear in. I’ve recently returned several pairs of shoes that cost more from other brands that were not nearly this quality.

I picked up the 12w and I love these shoes. They fit just as I expected, they look nice, and are very comfortable. My feet have enough room to breath, the toe room is adequate, and I have nice heel support. I got these on sale for about $55 and they were a bargain.

I love the clean and classic look of these shoes. And the fit is great. You can wear them all day and they are very comfortable.  The best part is these are my favorite shoes and I own about 20 pair of sneakers.  But these were the least expensive at $52 buck's!!!  It's really hard to find a great quality shoe along with the brand name like Puma for right around 50 buck's

I can only give these shoes one star because I couldn’t wear them. They are very stylish and looked appealing, but they are much smaller  in size. I wear a 12 but ordered a 13 just to be safe. I could get my feet inside. If you order these shoes, you may have to go two sizes up. I sent minds back and traveled to a local store in search of something.

I am worried I am a follower and fan of the puma and I always have my number 9 wide and it stays very tight as if it were an 8.5 wide and I always wear the sock this is very strange the weight of tennis does not have the weight that an original has
"
17624,"
Have always loved and worn Pumas. The latest pair have that ""fits like glove"" feel and they look great. I ordered this pair because my 10 year old pair finally fell apart.  Nothing looks or feels like Pumas...
"
17625,"
The size was way too small and the way it felt on my feet course more pain than anything.  I got a size 14. I gave them to my son who wears a 13 and they fit him better but even he says they are not very comfortable. Returns do not go through Amazon so I chose not to fight it and just let my son keep them

Outside measures wide but the cushioning makes it feel like a normal width.  Great style, low key yet still fashionable.  No stability support.
"
17643,"
I had bought several pairs previously. The first time I received them they were great. I felt like I was walking on clouds.I received this pair and they were to small. The insole was like tissue paper. I called, wrote, pleaded and they said NO to each request. I'm not revengeful but I'm upset. I'm disabled so it hurts when my feet feel like I'm walking on Concrete. I'm sending them back even though I won't get a refund or credit towards a trade in.Shame on them!
"
17644,"
Remarkably a cool style and look to these Puma Mens shoes.  Very comforitable  nice fitting shoes that support each foot very well.
"

This item fits perfect for a slim footed person.  If you have a wide foot, they may be too tight width wise.  They are comfortable and the size is right on target.  Excellent quality.  This is the third pair I have purchased; two for my youngest son within the last 12 years and one for my older son.

"

I have a high arch in my foot, most of my shoes need special inserts I buy separately. So when the shoes didn’t have any arch support I wasn’t surprised so I put in my inserts, they still didn’t give support!I figured out why, the shoes regular sole the upper part of the sole (the toes) is really think, thicker than the heel. It’s good for regular people who don’t need arch support because it’s “Squishy“ For comfort. But with my insole inserts it doesn’t allow my feet to get the proper arch support the insoles usually give.I have to take out the shoes soles and buy a regular insole at Walmart and then put my arch inserts and it seems to be fine now.

I've always worn Puma and so has my 13 year old son. I purchased these for him because his feet are growing like crazy. I bought the red and black ones because those are also his school colors.....well....... The bottoms are red and black but around the heel is a strip that I'm assuming is supposed to be red too but it's PINK!!! I'm very upset because he needs these shoes and can't wait for the return and the shipping time to get another pair.

I had heard some good and some bad regarding these shoes. The bad was that they may have not been authentic Puma athletic shoes.I can say that these are authentic Pumas as I received the shoe box. I have accidentally purchased knock-off shoes before.They fit well although I think that they are a bit loose around the ankle. I have beenPlaying with the shoe strings to get them tighter around the ankle.I really love the sleek look of the all-black and for the price that I paid ($55) you really can’t get a better cross-trainer style shoe that you can also wear out with jeans or slacks!

I had bought several pairs previously. The first time I received them they were great. I felt like I was walking on clouds.I received this pair and they were to small.

I have a high arch in my foot, most of my shoes need special inserts I buy separately. So when the shoes didn’t have any arch support I wasn’t surprised so I put in my inserts, they still didn’t give support!I figured out why, the shoes regular sole the upper part of the sole (the toes) is really think, thicker than the heel. It’s good for regular people who don’t need arch support because it’s “Squishy“ For comfort. But with my insole inserts it doesn’t allow my feet to get the proper arch support the insoles usually give.I have to take out the shoes soles and buy a regular insole at Walmart and then put my arch inserts and it seems to be fine now.

I've always worn Puma and so has my 13 year old son. I purchased these for him because his feet are growing like crazy. I bought the red and black ones because those are also his school colors.....well....... The bottoms are red and black but around the heel is a strip that I'm assuming is supposed to be red too but it's PINK!!! I'm very upset because he needs these shoes and can't wait for the return and the shipping time to get another pair.

Nice looking shoe but a bit narrow for my foot. On second thoughts I should have kept it and used a shoe stretcher to make it wider.

My podiatrist suggested getting an ankle high top shoe to muscles and loss of fine motor control in my left foot. I searched I looked at an array of shoes under $75 and this one really struck me I like the look of it I liked it was by Puma I used to wear them in high school lol. The shoes came in a very few days and their fit has really been great. I give the laces and authoritative pole and get them tight but not overly tight and my ankle and foot with the motor loss of control really respond well. For me at age 65 I still wanted my shoes to look good with jeans or whatever I wore and these do I just wouldn't have used quite as much gray on the side pieces by the laces but that's being pretty darn persnickety. I have never left a review before today, but these shoes just did what I wanted them to and more I'm very pleased with them of course bear mine this is only the first week.

I really like these sneakers, I wanted them in grey but that coloe is sold out which was the color I originally wanted them in. I ended up getting the black/red/white, which are very nice just not my style. I sent them back (only because I didn't like the color) but I'm keeping an eye on these sneakers because I would really love to get my hands on a pair of these in grey. The color I originally wanted.

The fit is excellent, decent mid top design. Would prefer a slightly higher support for the ankle. Most basketball shoes these days are not true hi-tops. Cushion is decent, but needs more in the heel of the shoe. The heel feels thin at the back of the shoe cushion wise and if playing basketball you need that extra cushion for the heel.

Found my 6 year old son a pair of these in size 13 off another provider. And wouldn't you know it! My Amazon feed showed me yhe exact shoe, minus some Velcro. An I bought them knowing my son an I would have yhe same matching shoes. Perfect for Puma lover's.

Some of the padding was put in each shoe unevenly. Seems like the right has more than left. Other then that really comfortable warm shoes
"
18475,"
I like the shoe.. looks cool.. might be well made.. I normally order a size 13 and they have a little room.. these felt like they put an entire brick in the tow.. my left foot is slightly bigger and I could not get the shoe on my foot completely. The right fit like if you curl your toes under and duct tape them. I would order a size up, maybe even two however they are not in stock. Can’t tell you any more about them than the fit being widely off.

Fits as expected and very comfortable. I purchased it for my husband's birthday and he's in love with it. He said its very light and comfortable no squeezing of toes. He is size 13 and a 13 was purchased . I suggest you take your size when ordering unless you prefer your shoes to fit  tighter or looser
"

My husband wears a 10.5 wide shoe. He said he would prefer to have an 11 next time. His toes are nearly to the end of the toe box and it doesn’t squeeze his foot width-wise but doesn’t allow him room for a thicker sock. They shipped quick and were gleaming white. He likes the style but felt the fit runs a bit snug.

Over three weeks I tried to break these in. I started with one area that eventually cleared up, but then another area on the right side hurt badly and wouldn’t go away. I thought maybe it’s my foot, but as soon as I switched back to Reebok their was no pain even during the first wear. These also had very little padding and I felt like I was wearing a worn out shoe. I was surprised as I didn’t think their would be much difference between brands, but their sure is and these did not work for me. I will not buy this brand again.

As a restaurant owner and chef, I purchased these sneakers to be my footwear in the kitchen.  After slipping only ONCE within an entire year with alternate / less expensive brands, I slipped twice this week wearing this product -- within 3 days!  I almost cracked my head on our steam table.  I'm guessing the tread is not great for the intention of running around a busy kitchen, with slip mats everywhere (I even slipped on a slip mat!).  Very unsatisfied.  Worn 3 times, but request a refund so that I might purchase a more amenable brand.

These are not leather. They are advertised as real leather, but they are fake leather shoes. Not good business at all, you should tell the customer accurate information so they don't go wasting money on fake products that aren't what's being sold.  The diamond symbols mean ""other material"" and not once is the leather symbol used meaning these are not made of leather.One star for the shady business false advertising. Shoes look cool, but I haven't put them on as I am going to be returning these $64 plastic shoes.Go to the PUMA website, they have them on sale for $40 and they even have them correctly labeled as synthetic. As I edit this comment weeks after, they still show ""Leather"" as the first thing on the product.

I love these shoes! I’m a zumba instructor and struggle to find good shows for teaching so many classes per week. I’ve struggled from plantar issues, calf problems, knee problems etc, and these shoes have relieved a lot of that. They are wider than a typical shoe but you can tighten the laces more if you need them more narrow. They have a lot of cushion in the shoe and it’s supportive. The shoes are fake leather, but they look nice and have held up over a year and a half for me (rotating with other shoes). I ordered 1.5 sizes down from my typical women’s size to adjust for the men’s sizes listed here. You’ll love these!
"
18617,"
These are WAY too small.  Almost every single pair of shoes I own, from multiple brands, are size 8.  These in an 8 barely fit my foot and are actually painful to wear.Seem like they would be great shoes if the sizing was anywhere near accurate.

I loved the feel of the shoe as soon as I put my foot in. However my feet are wide and with multiple reviews saying size up I figured I’d size up by .5. It feels great and does fit however for more comfort I’d size up by a whole size instead of just .5!

Me encanta el diseño que tienen, a pesar de que su plantilla parezca o sea una hoja de foami grueso (+-1cm) es muy cómodo, la talla es la justa, mi pie mide aprox 27cm-27.2 y la talla 27.5cm me quedo justo, no lo siento tan grande pero tampoco apretado, estoy muy cómodo al caminar o estando de pie. Claro que sí te gusta algo suelto puedes elegir una talla más grande pero creo que media talla más está bien. Si acaso lo único ""malo"" sería que en la bota hay una partes que son de tela no vinil que se manchan fácil pero nada grave, en general se siente de calidad, falta ver qué tan duraderos son.

Adquirí este producto el 20 de octubre del 2019, dejé de usarlos a mediados de marzo. En menos de seis meses de uso alternado toda la parte frontal del tenis derecho se desprendió, soy una persona que camina mucho, pero no utilizo este calzado para realizar actividades deportivas, sólo caminar, Me parece que para no tener un desgaste significativo duró demasiado poco .El diseño me fascinó, este tipo de tenis me encantan y PUMA suele tener un excelente gusto estético, ojalá que también lo supieran complementar con materiales de buena calidad, y una confección y elaboración que esté a la altura de la marca. Me dejó muy decepcionado.

My podiatrist suggested getting an ankle high top shoe to muscles and loss of fine motor control in my left foot. I searched I looked at an array of shoes under $75 and this one really struck me I like the look of it I liked it was by Puma I used to wear them in high school lol. The shoes came in a very few days and their fit has really been great. I give the laces and authoritative pole and get them tight but not overly tight and my ankle and foot with the motor loss of control really respond well. For me at age 65 I still wanted my shoes to look good with jeans or whatever I wore and these do I just wouldn't have used quite as much gray on the side pieces by the laces but that's being pretty darn persnickety. I have never left a review before today, but these shoes just did what I wanted them to and more I'm very pleased with them of course bear mine this is only the first week. But don't tell my left foot that it's enjoying the break and the vacation that it feels like it's gotten on now LOL because it helped prevent pain and gave me muscle support while I walked so that I don't limp I give this shoe five stars and two thumbs very high up

The fit is excellent, decent mid top design. Would prefer a slightly higher support for the ankle. Most basketball shoes these days are not true hi-tops. Cushion is decent, but needs more in the heel of the shoe. The heel feels thin at the back of the shoe cushion wise and if playing basketball you need that extra cushion for the heel.

I like the shoe.. looks cool.. might be well made.. I normally order a size 13 and they have a little room.. these felt like they put an entire brick in the tow.. my left foot is slightly bigger and I could not get the shoe on my foot completely. The right fit like if you curl your toes under and duct tape them. I would order a size up, maybe even two however they are not in stock. Can’t tell you any more about them than the fit being widely off.

My husband wears a 10.5 wide shoe. He said he would prefer to have an 11 next time. His toes are nearly to the end of the toe box and it doesn’t squeeze his foot width-wise but doesn’t allow him room for a thicker sock. They shipped quick and were gleaming white. He likes the style but felt the fit runs a bit snug.

Over three weeks I tried to break these in. I started with one area that eventually cleared up, but then another area on the right side hurt badly and wouldn’t go away. I thought maybe it’s my foot, but as soon as I switched back to Reebok their was no pain even during the first wear. These also had very little padding and I felt like I was wearing a worn out shoe. I was surprised as I didn’t think their would be much difference between brands, but their sure is and these did not work for me. I will not buy this brand again.

As a restaurant owner and chef, I purchased these sneakers to be my footwear in the kitchen.  After slipping only ONCE within an entire year with alternate / less expensive brands, I slipped twice this week wearing this product -- within 3 days!  I almost cracked my head on our steam table.  I'm guessing the tread is not great for the intention of running around a busy kitchen, with slip mats everywhere (I even slipped on a slip mat!).  Very unsatisfied.  Worn 3 times, but request a refund so that I might purchase a more amenable brand.

These are not leather. They are advertised as real leather, but they are fake leather shoes. Not good business at all, you should tell the customer accurate information so they don't go wasting money on fake products that aren't what's being sold.  The diamond symbols mean ""other material"" and not once is the leather symbol used meaning these are not made of leather.One star for the shady business false advertising. Shoes look cool, but I haven't put them on as I am going to be returning these $64 plastic shoes.Go to the PUMA website, they have them on sale for $40 and they even have them correctly labeled as synthetic. As I edit this comment weeks after, they still show ""Leather"" as the first thing on the product.

I love these shoes! I’m a zumba instructor and struggle to find good shows for teaching so many classes per week. I’ve struggled from plantar issues, calf problems, knee problems etc, and these shoes have relieved a lot of that. They are wider than a typical shoe but you can tighten the laces more if you need them more narrow. They have a lot of cushion in the shoe and it’s supportive. The shoes are fake leather, but they look nice and have held up over a year and a half for me (rotating with other shoes). I ordered 1.5 sizes down from my typical women’s size to adjust for the men’s sizes listed here. You’ll love these!
"
18954,"
These are WAY too small.  Almost every single pair of shoes I own, from multiple brands, are size 8.  These in an 8 barely fit my foot and are actually painful to wear.Seem like they would be great shoes if the sizing was anywhere near accurate.

I bought these shoes bout 1 1/2 years back and I’m a dancer so they reached the end of their life more quickly than if If I wore them out and about but I just bought new ones to replace my old ones because I dance best in these they have foam inserts that help keep your foot cozy if you’re gonna be in them for a long period of time and the high top supports your ankles!

I bought these shoes for my brother. I bought these just by estimating his shoes size and size guide icon helped me to pick the right size. And let me tell you he love it.

I loved the feel of the shoe as soon as I put my foot in. However my feet are wide and with multiple reviews saying size up I figured I’d size up by .5. It feels great and does fit however for more comfort I’d size up by a whole size instead of just .5!
"
18998,"
Me encanta el diseño que tienen, a pesar de que su plantilla parezca o sea una hoja de foami grueso (+-1cm) es muy cómodo, la talla es la justa, mi pie mide aprox 27cm-27.2 y la talla 27.5cm me quedo justo, no lo siento tan grande pero tampoco apretado, estoy muy cómodo al caminar o estando de pie. Claro que sí te gusta algo suelto puedes elegir una talla más grande pero creo que media talla más está bien. Si acaso lo único ""malo"" sería que en la bota hay una partes que son de tela no vinil que se manchan fácil pero nada grave, en general se siente de calidad, falta ver qué tan duraderos son.

They look and feel very good, especially for the price (~$75 as of the time of my purchase). However, if you are also a wide-footed individual, these might be a little too tight for your feet.

Adquirí este producto el 20 de octubre del 2019, dejé de usarlos a mediados de marzo. En menos de seis meses de uso alternado toda la parte frontal del tenis derecho se desprendió, soy una persona que camina mucho, pero no utilizo este calzado para realizar actividades deportivas, sólo caminar, Me parece que para no tener un desgaste significativo duró demasiado poco .El diseño me fascinó, este tipo de tenis me encantan y PUMA suele tener un excelente gusto estético, ojalá que también lo supieran complementar con materiales de buena calidad, y una confección y elaboración que esté a la altura de la marca. Me dejó muy decepcionado.

Fitted perfectly
"
19069,"
I went to a normal shoe store and tried on like a dozen different pairs of shoes. None of them were comfortable for my feet, as I have less padding on the bottom of my feet than other people. I tried these on in a size that was a little off, and they fit almost the way they should have, so I ordered the right size from Amazon. When I got the correct size in, they were quite comfy, like the equivalent of a spa for my feet. The only issue I had was that I experienced a little bit of heel pain on occasion, maybe a harder plastic is used at the base of the heel in these, or maybe my feet just have issues. Still amazingly comfortable over all (though I normally just buy cheap shoes from Walmart, so take that for what it's worth). I will say though, with them being as snug and padded as they are, I don't know that I would use them as long duration running shoes in hot weather. I imagine they would get pretty sweaty. Your results may vary.

I've wanted to get another pair of pumas for awhile now but every pair I've tried didn't fit my foot good enough for one reason or another so I gave up for a couple years.  I bought these because it gave me the option to try before you buy. With shoes and cloths that is such a great thing I must say. I alway try before I buy in those situations.  I gave it a shot and they fit. I have a wide foot and I wear a size 12ish depending on the shoe. These fit me just fine and wearing them for abit will stretch them out a bit more I'm sure so I'm happy with them and they look nice as well. I did get them at a discounted price, ""prime day deal"" so I'm happy for what I paid as well. Thank you prime day and try before you buy, I finally got a pair of pumas in my collection again, yeah. Oh, their comfy and lightweight as well.

This is the second pair of these shoes I have recently purchased (first pair in black) and I am pleased with the overall aspects of these shoes. However, it should be noted that the size runs small. You should order one whole size larger than your normal shoe size. It should also be noted that the color of this shoe appears to be a shade of brown in the online Amazon photo. The actual shoe is a muted gray-green. NOT brown, which was/is disappointing, but I have decided not to return the shoe.

Now that I've retired, upscale pumas are the look I prefer for casual wear.  I have another pair of the Alexion shoes that are light gray with burgundy accents.  These shoes in dark gray with black accents are the perfect complement to the first pair.  They're well made, super comfortable and they look wicked good with khakis, jeans or shorts.  Socks or no socks, take your pick.  I do have a high instep so I order up one-half size from my usual size and this allows me to give these Pumas 5 stars.  I've tried Pumas in 11, but they're just too tight and a hair too short.  I bought the first pair two years ago and they still look great.  I don't know how they would hold up to daily wear as a running shoe, but that's not why I bought them.

These shoes are sooo comfortable and I have several spinal injuries and mobility issues… I love them, I have extra wide feet and always have to order a 1/2 size larger in Puma shoes, even 20 years ago, however knowing that, the shoes fit perfectly and I don’t need insoles.The white and silver accents are so stylish and I recommend them!!!

I can't give a 5 star rating because I haven't used it long enough to see if anything negative occurs. So far I'm very impressed with the quality and the fit. Durability is what I'm waiting to find out now but that will differ based on an individual's personal use. All in all I'll say it's a gr8 buy.

I actually really love these shoes. But hence, they are white and I cannot stand for my shoes to be dirty. So I took the laces out and washed them. Now I’ve spent HOURS trying to re-lace them. The lacing system is complicated and I still haven’t figured it out. Just be aware of this if (like me) you wash your shoelaces and such often.

I am a size 10 and couldn't find the white/gray combo and stumbled into the men's section for Puma. I love this style of shoe specifically for my HIIT workouts and weight training -I love them!From now on, I will always check for a men's equivalent if I cant find what I need in women's or want to compare prices. they look almost exactly the same. Happy customer!

Solid Shoe. 5/5 for me. Fits as expected for me. (Although the consensus is that they run a bit large, so adjust accordingly.) Light and flexible enough to work well as a running shoe, while providing enough rigidity to work as a day to day shoe as well. Great price, and great quality so far. Solid product.
"
19154,"
Not the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever worn. I often find myself in 11 1/2 or 12 Needed the 12 in the shoe but it still feels a little tight. It’s a really good looking shoe so I’ll just hope that they break in or live with it.

"

This is a bad buy.  The shoes are very nice looking online.  However, the rubber soles are around 1/8 thick, then they have cardboard on top of the soles. On top of the cardboard, you have your typical shoe inserts.  Do not get them wet or they will fall apart.  If you work out in them the will defently hurt your feet.

These sneakers look great, however they are too tight in width.

I bought these shoes to replace and older pair of Puma sneakers for exercising (running, elliptical, etc.). After one session on the elliptical, I noticed intense pain and swelling in my foot the next day. I went to an orthopedic surgeon, and it turns out that my foot had been fractured. The surgeon immediately identified these shoes as the culprit. They are too flimsy for rigorous exercise, or even daily wear, to be considered safe to wear. They easily bend with your foot and do not offer firm support. This lack of rigidity allowed my foot to fracture due to repeated impacts on an angle which should not have even existed.

From the moment you put these on your feet you feel the responsive memory foam material. I'm a petsitter so I walk lots of dogs. I need something with both good grip and comfort on the hard pavement.

I had to exchange for a larger size.  The first pair of Pumas were to small.  So the process to exchange was fast and easy.  Thany you Amazon, turnaround only took three days.

The shoe cost much less than another popular brand, yet looks just as good. FYI....they are much more comfortable than that other overpriced brand as well according to my husband.

Non ce niente da dire, Puma è sempre una garanzia, scarpe bellissime e comode fanno la sua bella figura con la sua forma che si distingue dalle altre scarpe anche di marca. Parecchie persone mi chiedono dove le ho comprate.Un consiglio che posso dare è di tenere i lacci larghi in modo da allentare i due lati della scarpa rendendolo così la scarpa più comoda altrimenti in caso contrario potrebbe farvi male il piede.

I loved these shoes and was so looking forward to wearing them. Needless to say, I wore them only once and they totally destroyed my feet. The Achilles notch cut into both my Achilles’ tendons after just one stroll. They are made really hard and since the shoes that I got were made smaller than what I usually wear, they cut up my Achilles’ tendons, leaving my shoes bloody and my Achilles’ tendons severely damaged to the point that I could not wear socks or shoes for three weeks. I highly recommend getting a larger size

I've wanted to get another pair of pumas for awhile now but every pair I've tried didn't fit my foot good enough for one reason or another so I gave up for a couple years.  I bought these because it gave me the option to try before you buy. With shoes and cloths that is such a great thing I must say. I alway try before I buy in those situations.  I gave it a shot and they fit. I have a wide foot and I wear a size 12ish depending on the shoe. These fit me just fine and wearing them for abit will stretch them out a bit more I'm sure so I'm happy with them and they look nice as well. I did get them at a discounted price, ""prime day deal"" so I'm happy for what I paid as well. Thank you prime day and try before you buy, I finally got a pair of pumas in my collection again, yeah. Oh, their comfy and lightweight as well.

This is the second pair of these shoes I have recently purchased (first pair in black) and I am pleased with the overall aspects of these shoes. However, it should be noted that the size runs small. You should order one whole size larger than your normal shoe size. It should also be noted that the color of this shoe appears to be a shade of brown in the online Amazon photo. The actual shoe is a muted gray-green. NOT brown, which was/is disappointing, but I have decided not to return the shoe.

Now that I've retired, upscale pumas are the look I prefer for casual wear.  I have another pair of the Alexion shoes that are light gray with burgundy accents.  These shoes in dark gray with black accents are the perfect complement to the first pair.  They're well made, super comfortable and they look wicked good with khakis, jeans or shorts.  Socks or no socks, take your pick.  I do have a high instep so I order up one-half size from my usual size and this allows me to give these Pumas 5 stars.  I've tried Pumas in 11, but they're just too tight and a hair too short.  I bought the first pair two years ago and they still look great.  I don't know how they would hold up to daily wear as a running shoe, but that's not why I bought them.

I actually really love these shoes. But hence, they are white and I cannot stand for my shoes to be dirty. So I took the laces out and washed them. Now I’ve spent HOURS trying to re-lace them.

Solid Shoe. 5/5 for me. Fits as expected for me. (Although the consensus is that they run a bit large, so adjust accordingly.) Light and flexible enough to work well as a running shoe, while providing enough rigidity to work as a day to day shoe as well. Great price, and great quality so far. Solid product.

Not the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever worn. I often find myself in 11 1/2 or 12 Needed the 12 in the shoe but it still feels a little tight. It’s a really good looking shoe so I’ll just hope that they break in or live with it.

This is a bad buy.  The shoes are very nice looking online.  However, the rubber soles are around 1/8 thick, then they have cardboard on top of the soles. On top of the cardboard, you have your typical shoe inserts.  Do not get them wet or they will fall apart.  If you work out in them the will defently hurt your feet.

I bought these shoes to replace and older pair of Puma sneakers for exercising (running, elliptical, etc.). After one session on the elliptical, I noticed intense pain and swelling in my foot the next day. I went to an orthopedic surgeon, and it turns out that my foot had been fractured. The surgeon immediately identified these shoes as the culprit. They are too flimsy for rigorous exercise, or even daily wear, to be considered safe to wear. They easily bend with your foot and do not offer firm support. This lack of rigidity allowed my foot to fracture due to repeated impacts on an angle which should not have even existed.

I bought these to do a lot of walking in but they are too uncomfortable and actually painful to walk in. The toe is actually a point like a boot so your toes take a beating. I waited a couple of weeks hoping they would loosen up but they have not. I will not buy these shoes again.

I have only worn the shoes a total of 6 times and the left shoe has a clicking noise that I'm not sure what it is coming from. To me it feels like the soul has come loose from the rest of the shoe somehow internally. I do not recommend these shoes. Maybe you will have better luck

From the moment you put these on your feet you feel the responsive memory foam material. I'm a petsitter so I walk lots of dogs. I need something with both good grip and comfort on the hard pavement. These Pumas offer both in spades.I honestly can't remember a more comfortable pair of my sneakers in my life. Obviously very happy with these.
"
19611,"
I had to exchange for a larger size.  The first pair of Pumas were to small.  So the process to exchange was fast and easy.  Thany you Amazon, turnaround only took three days.  My refund took only a day.  The new Pumas look an feel just fine.  Pumas run a little narrow so you may have to go to the next size up to get a proper fit.
"

super plush for your feet...look huge as they have a lot of leather.beautiful shoe ..my only complaint w/ pumas is that they are thing in front...its a different feel than other shoes..but the gushy shoe here gives plenty of comfort..looking forward to putting theses through the paces...
"

Very stylish looking shoe. I've actually received compliments regarding them. I would have given them a 5/5 but they run a little narrow on my foot. Not as comfortable as my numerousAdidas sneakers but not far behind. 4.5/5

Puma has variations of this same style, and I have one other pair that is somewhat similar. To me this is the best look they have achieved with this style.

Non ce niente da dire, Puma è sempre una garanzia, scarpe bellissime e comode fanno la sua bella figura con la sua forma che si distingue dalle altre scarpe anche di marca. Parecchie persone mi chiedono dove le ho comprate.Un consiglio che posso dare è di tenere i lacci larghi in modo da allentare i due lati della scarpa rendendolo così la scarpa più comoda altrimenti in caso contrario potrebbe farvi male il piede.

I loved these shoes and was so looking forward to wearing them. Needless to say, I wore them only once and they totally destroyed my feet. The Achilles notch cut into both my Achilles’ tendons after just one stroll. They are made really hard and since the shoes that I got were made smaller than what I usually wear, they cut up my Achilles’ tendons, leaving my shoes bloody and my Achilles’ tendons severely damaged to the point that I could not wear socks or shoes for three weeks. I highly recommend getting a larger size

Worst shoe ever. The orthotic has a very thick pad under the front of the foot making the shoe an empty shell if you try to replace her orthotic since there is no suck orthotic like it anywhere.

Worst shoe ever. The orthotic has a very thick pad under the front of the foot making the shoe an empty shell if you try to replace her orthotic since there is no suck orthotic like it anywhere. Absolutely the worst designed sneaker ever. Do not ever buy this shoe. Puma customer service is the absolute worst. You can only email them and then they email back and say no to everything.

So far, I wore them for 5 golf holes and practice at the range beforehand. They are comfortable but I did not want to chance walking 18 in a brand new pair. They are very stylish and love the color scheme. They are not as soft as a new pair of Skechers so that’s why I changed them after 5 holes. The stiffness they have will need a little breaking in.

Have to wear a lift in my right shoe and this shoe is deep enough in the heel that I don’t feel myself walking out of it.Only issue and I still give it 5 stars, due to this rarity. I had read if water gets in the shoe, then your foot will stay wet all round.  Was in a deluge downpour yesterday and that is true.  In fact I felt I’d let the inside of the shoe dry out more today …even after using a shoe dryer and stuffing towels in overnight.  I don’t ever look to play in rain, and this rain was the most I’ve ever been caught in on a course…but zero issue walking on a dewy morning in terms of water getting in….That being said, I ordered another pair that is how much I love these shoes!!

I like the fit, the disc for tightening the cables is... gimmicky but works all right, and the traction is decent across many surfaces, but the waterproofing is only appropriate for extremely short grass.  I play in the early morning so there tends to be a lot of dew on the ground, if the grass is even just a few inches tall, my feet are soaked, likely due to the mesh on top of shoe.  Once water gets in, the waterproofing helps make sure that it never gets out again.  I've tried contacting Puma but they make it really hard to get any customer service.  The shoes have a 1 year waterproof warranty, and I'd say my feet started getting soaked within a month of using them.
"
19882,"
This shoe is unwearable after 2 rounds of ankle abuse.  My previous pair, the way it was made, the side that goes under your ankle bone was cut lower, made for a great fit.  This pair that area is noticeably higher and cuts into the side of my ankle just below the ankle bone.  If you wear a no shoe sock they are unbearable to play with. Tightened, loosened, tried everything, no good.  only thing that helps a little is a full sock.  Still cuts into the ankle, but it gives a little padding.  Issue might be unique to me, but i doubt it.

I ordered a 10.5 size and it came too large. Said it was a 10.5, but my foot was swimming around. The heel cut on the back of the ankle was undercut which made the shoe dig into my Achilles. It was just uncomfortable, and the size was incorrect to what it was labelled

Seem to run around a half size large like everyone says  which I thought would be perfect for me since I often fit true to a 11  but need more room in the toes. Well, it turns out these run a bit narrow in toes despite their overall larger size which kind of defeated the purpose for me. Because ordering a 11 wide or 11.5  with these is out  of the question . But what I did was take out the insert and replace it with a thinner one in the toes which worked perfectly. Same  thing could be done with a thicker insert if there was a little too much room. I mention all this because for me these are excellent golf shoes in looks and how stable they are when playing and addressing the ball. Surprisingly comfortable for me as well once I replaced the insert and have worn them while walking the course and had no foot issues. For me, at some of the prices currently going, I think they are as good a golf shoe as you can get IF you can manage the fitting  which is not a given by any stretch.

Very comfortable. The tightening system is great. Turn the disk clockwise to tighten it as to what feels comfortable. Turn 1/4 turn counterclockwise and they completely loosen so you can take them off. The shoe has a unique system to snug your foot in the shoe without being overly tight. I really like mine. I’ve played quite a few rounds of golf in them since March.  Shoe also has plenty of grip when swinging.

I ordered a 10.5 size and it came too large. Said it was a 10.5, but my foot was swimming around. The heel cut on the back of the ankle was undercut which made the shoe dig into my Achilles. It was just uncomfortable, and the size was incorrect to what it was labelled

Good shoe. The problem is their  way heavier than competitors and when your walking 18 holes you don’t need the extra weight. Stay awayTrust me buy a lighter shoe. This is coming from a puma fan.

Seem to run around a half size large like everyone says  which I thought would be perfect for me since I often fit true to a 11  but need more room in the toes. Well, it turns out these run a bit narrow in toes despite their overall larger size which kind of defeated the purpose for me. Because ordering a 11 wide or 11.5  with these is out  of the question . But what I did was take out the insert and replace it with a thinner one in the toes which worked perfectly. Same  thing could be done with a thicker insert if there was a little too much room. I mention all this because for me these are excellent golf shoes in looks and how stable they are when playing and addressing the ball. Surprisingly comfortable for me as well once I replaced the insert and have worn them while walking the course and had no foot issues. For me, at some of the prices currently going, I think they are as good a golf shoe as you can get IF you can manage the fitting  which is not a given by any stretch.

Very comfortable. The tightening system is great. Turn the disk clockwise to tighten it as to what feels comfortable. Turn 1/4 turn counterclockwise and they completely loosen so you can take them off. The shoe has a unique system to snug your foot in the shoe without being overly tight. I really like mine. I’ve played quite a few rounds of golf in them since March.  Shoe also has plenty of grip when swinging.

Ich bin mehr als beeindruckt. Die Fotos in der Anzeige werden dem Schuh nicht gerecht.Zum passgefühl und Eignung will ich nicht viel sagen. Ich denke jeder kennt diese Art Schuh. Er ist elastisch, formbar und passt so oder so.Super und clever verarbeitet. Das Material ist gut gewählt und robust gegen Kratzer und andere Schäden die manchen Schuhen sofort nicht abwaschbare Markel zufügen.Ideal für Hektiker! Man kann kaum einfacherer und schneller in einen Schuh rein- und rausschlüpfen und trotzdem den ganzen Tag passgenau darin laufen. Zudem ist es unmöglich, dass sich der schuh bei ungeschickter hecktick irgendwie verknickt. Einfach genial, Würde sowas gerne öfter sehen.Gäbe es das häufiger für Kinder hätten wir eine ganze Generation die niemals lernen müsste Schnürsenkel zu binden.

I'dd intended to replace my running shoes with these however the position of the laces doesn't feel comfortable and caused a bit of pain when I managed to tighten them, but the laces run through small rubber panels which makes it difficult to pull them tight.

Also the sole on the inside is loose and moves forwards leaving and obvious gap of where it should be in the heel.

The back of the heel is too short, it slips off too easily. Everything is too shallow, either add another string eyelet or raise the back of the heel so they don't slip off when walking.They are very easy to kick off without untying, but I'd rather have them grip better when wearing and walking.

These are my work shoes. Im on my feet all day. My feet never complain, no breaking in required. They slip on and hug your feet. That's it. They have good traction too. When I encounter spills I don't worry about slipping. Looks good too. I got all black. Goes with anything and doesn't show dirt. 👍

Ich bin mehr als beeindruckt. Die Fotos in der Anzeige werden dem Schuh nicht gerecht.Zum passgefühl und Eignung will ich nicht viel sagen. Ich denke jeder kennt diese Art Schuh. Er ist elastisch, formbar und passt so oder so.Super und clever verarbeitet. Das Material ist gut gewählt und robust gegen Kratzer und andere Schäden die manchen Schuhen sofort nicht abwaschbare Markel zufügen.Ideal für Hektiker! Man kann kaum einfacherer und schneller in einen Schuh rein- und rausschlüpfen und trotzdem den ganzen Tag passgenau darin laufen. Zudem ist es unmöglich, dass sich der schuh bei ungeschickter hecktick irgendwie verknickt. Einfach genial, Würde sowas gerne öfter sehen.Gäbe es das häufiger für Kinder hätten wir eine ganze Generation die niemals lernen müsste Schnürsenkel zu binden.

I'dd intended to replace my running shoes with these however the position of the laces doesn't feel comfortable and caused a bit of pain when I managed to tighten them, but the laces run through small rubber panels which makes it difficult to pull them tight. Overall left a bit disappointed with them but they work as a shoe so I wear them a bit. Also the sole on the inside is loose and moves forwards leaving and obvious gap of where it should be in the heel.

Having worn PUMA sneakers for years, I find they are one of the few remaining brands that are1: comfortable2. well made3. durable4. reasonably priced5. not overly ostentatiousThis is probably my fifth pair of PUMA sneakers over the past years and I return to this brand time and again because they are well made, hold up and most importantly, COMFORTABLE!  Definitely recommend.

First of all, I love ""classic"" Pumas and have been wearing them for a long, long time.  I have always purchased the suede fabric in many color combinations and they are always stylish.  The fit has always been spot-on (I am a 9 1/2).  Comfortable and good looking.  Delivery was quick and with no problems at all.  Highly recommended.
"
20342,"
They fit really narrow and they were really tight when I first put them on. But I wore them to the store and they loosened up and felt better. They come with a gel insert soul which I found comfortable for walking. I wear a 10 but ordered a 10.5 just to be sure but a 10 would have been fine as they have plenty of toe room.Not quite as stylish as the suede but still a bit of an eye catcher.
"
20343,"
A couple people have commented on my shoes since I bought these.  They are fairly sharp looking shoes but not overly attention grabbing.  I got a 1/2 size up from my normal shoe size (normally a 10.5, went to an 11) and they fit very comfortably.I work in an office and these are comfortable office shoes.  I'm pretty happy with them.  My only reservation is that the laces are pretty short.

The shoes look amazing for sure. Puma is my favorite brand by far. However, for whatever reason these shoes just didn't fit the same as with other puma suede shoes.

I typically wear size 12 shoes but knowlingly seeing how narrow these shoes are. I knew i would need to get size 13s and they were perfect!

I bought these as a previous fan of the Puma Super Liga. I was going through pairs every 3 months, and wanted something more durable. These shoes look and fit great, and are standing up to the test of time much better than the Super Ligas.

Horrible.  No human with an 11 1/2 foot could possibly fit into this shoe.  Ludicrously narrow.  This shoe would not fit a 6 year old. I am not exaggerating. This is a disgrace.  Puma should be ashamed.

They felt like a size too small. And they are very narrow. My Skechers in same style fit perfect and are way more comfortable. But maybe these are more cool and hip?
"

They are too narrow!  I am hoping they will stretch out with time, but they aren't as comfortable as I had hoped.  These look great but the jury is still out on comfort.  If you have narrow feet, these are a great value.  If you have wider feet, I'd suggest a pass.

Puma have become my trainers of choice. They look good, are very comfortable and they last for ages!Importantly for me, they also come in larger men's sizes. I am a size 12 but have found that with other trainers, I often have to buy a size 13 to get a comfortable fit - particularly with thicker socks. That's not the case with Puma footwear with accurate and even a tad generous sizing.Next day Prime delivery is a bonus.I usually protect the trainers with a suitable suede protector and use a foam cleaner when necessary. After a couple of months, they still look and feel like new. The foam insoles ensure comfort - even after a long walk or bout of exercise.I have no complaints!

A simple vista el color de los tenis llega a verse como color blanco. Al igual que los tenis de color blanco este color gris claro combina con prácticamente cualquier ropa que te pongas.

These are nice shoes but with anything Puma, they either run too narrow or small.  This is the case with these shoes as they would not be suitable with someone who has wide feet.  I like these shoes but just a tad bit too narrow.

Having worn PUMA sneakers for years, I find they are one of the few remaining brands that are1: comfortable2. well made3. durable4. reasonably priced5. not overly ostentatiousThis is probably my fifth pair of PUMA sneakers over the past years and I return to this brand time and again because they are well made, hold up and most importantly, COMFORTABLE!  Definitely recommend.

First of all, I love ""classic"" Pumas and have been wearing them for a long, long time.  I have always purchased the suede fabric in many color combinations and they are always stylish.  The fit has always been spot-on (I am a 9 1/2).  Comfortable and good looking.  Delivery was quick and with no problems at all.  Highly recommended.
"
20574,"
They fit really narrow and they were really tight when I first put them on. But I wore them to the store and they loosened up and felt better. They come with a gel insert soul which I found comfortable for walking. I wear a 10 but ordered a 10.5 just to be sure but a 10 would have been fine as they have plenty of toe room.Not quite as stylish as the suede but still a bit of an eye catcher.
"
20575,"
A couple people have commented on my shoes since I bought these.  They are fairly sharp looking shoes but not overly attention grabbing.  I got a 1/2 size up from my normal shoe size (normally a 10.5, went to an 11) and they fit very comfortably.I work in an office and these are comfortable office shoes.  I'm pretty happy with them.  My only reservation is that the laces are pretty short.
"

NICE SHOE. THEY SAY THAT THESE ARE TRUE FIT. I ORDERED A 9 (MY SIZE) AND IT WAS TOO TIGHT! i WAS GOING TO RETURN AND GET A HALF SIZE LARGER BUT THEY RAISED THE PRIZE BY $13.00. WOULD HAVE ENJOYED THEM IF THEY FIT!

This Product I have been using for 6 months now. Feels comfortable when you walk. Most of the time I used to wear running shoes because I walk at least 4 hours daily. After purchasing this shoes my feet's felt very relaxed .

Always liked the look of the black suede.  Big fan of Adidas Gazelle which are expensive and really to come by.So for $40 I got the cool puma look and are very stylish.

they are really comfortable, but they are a little large on the toe cap, i guess that's because they are narrow on the toe cap.

Overall love the shoe.  Probably due to how I walk, but the tongue tends to move to the side.  Which can be annoying.

After a long walk these shoes felt a little small, fine for casual kicking around tho, really like them overall.

I’ve been looking for these to go on sale and jumped on them as soon as I saw they were about 50% less than anywhere else. Super cute for a woman or man and fit perfectly.  So comfortable too!

The shoes look amazing for sure. Puma is my favorite brand by far. However, for whatever reason these shoes just didn't fit the same as with other puma suede shoes. There was a lot of space in the toe area. I got a size 10 which is what I always get with puma shoes. Unfortunately I had to return it, but I picked up another pair of puma classic suedes. Would have loved to have gotten the blue, gold, white color though.

I bought these as a previous fan of the Puma Super Liga. I was going through pairs every 3 months, and wanted something more durable. These shoes look and fit great, and are standing up to the test of time much better than the Super Ligas.

Nice shoe, seems like decent quality.  The toe of these things are like women's dress shoes though!  I don't know whose foot tapers to a point at the toes, but mine does not.  The soles are also very thin and you'll feel everything you step on.  Had to return them as I couldn't find a wide option.

Horrible.  No human with an 11 1/2 foot could possibly fit into this shoe.  Ludicrously narrow.  This shoe would not fit a 6 year old. I am not exaggerating. This is a disgrace.  Puma should be ashamed.

Wore these shoes daily for about 3 months and the ankle support are already falling apart. The original design of the pair that costs about $35 were a lot better, but cannot find them for sale anywhere. Highly disappointed with this purchase!

I've walked in these on pavement for only about 200 hours and a hole has started to form on the bottomthey use cheap rubber so you have to buy their shoes more often but I'm never buying this brand again

They felt like a size too small. And they are very narrow. My Skechers in same style fit perfect and are way more comfortable. But maybe these are more cool and hip?
"
20697,"
They are too narrow!  I am hoping they will stretch out with time, but they aren't as comfortable as I had hoped.  These look great but the jury is still out on comfort.  If you have narrow feet, these are a great value.  If you have wider feet, I'd suggest a pass.

Puma have become my trainers of choice. They look good, are very comfortable and they last for ages!Importantly for me, they also come in larger men's sizes. I am a size 12 but have found that with other trainers, I often have to buy a size 13 to get a comfortable fit - particularly with thicker socks. That's not the case with Puma footwear with accurate and even a tad generous sizing.Next day Prime delivery is a bonus.I usually protect the trainers with a suitable suede protector and use a foam cleaner when necessary. After a couple of months, they still look and feel like new. The foam insoles ensure comfort - even after a long walk or bout of exercise.I have no complaints!

What you need to know.Pros:1.  The shoe is easy to clean.2.  It looks fairly stylish3.  It hugs your ankle well so it fits to the foot well and isn't loose.4.  It's fairly comfortable not to bad.5.  It's priced fairly good for what your paying.Cons:1.  The shoe materials are some what average, and some parts don't really seem to sturdy in the construction which concerns me already. (The lip in front and sides)2.  SIZING!  I am generally a size 11, however I have a wide foot.  Some people have stated on here it's puma sizing and so you should go a size larger.  This is not correct in my opinion.  First off if you order a size bigger it's simply going to be slightly wider and longer.  However when you put the shoe on, it's going to feel comfortable but your going to have about 3/4 inch extra in the front.  So to correctly get the size that's best for you I recommend only going a size above IF the current size you've been wearing in other shoes is always tight and your toes are cramped in the front of the shoe.  If you find the size your wearing is tight on the sides where the shoe curves in, then just get a wider size.  People have also said that you should order a size larger because it can feel tight on your feet even if it fits, but being the owner of numerous Puma shoes in the past, I've found that after about 1 month the shoes break in and don't feel tight anymore.  So in conclusion if you are normally a size 9,10,11,12 etc then stay with that size and just get a size wider if your concerned about it being a little tight around the curve.  However if your all about maximum comfort then yes go for a size larger so you can have maximum space.

I really like these shoes.  They are similar to driving shoes.  They are very comfortable if you are not going to be walking on uneven ground or something like gravel on a regular basis.  Even when you do walk on surfaces like gravel, the sole is not so thin that it is necessarily uncomfortable.  There isn't much arch support though if you need that in a shoe.  I found the sole and outer upper will separate if you wear them on a daily basis.  After a year it started to slightly separate and I added some ShoeGoo to stop any further progression.  I think they will last for another year and a half at least (they are my primary shoes).My first purchase was early in 2021 and now late in 2022 I have purchased another pair to ensure I will have a pair when the first wears out.  I am always concerned when I find a pair of shoes I like that they will go out of production.  I should be good for the next five years.The fit is about right.  If you have a wide foot it may be problematic.  I have a normal to slightly narrow foot and they fit well for me.

These make great cycling shoes, and I don’t bike long-distance without them!  A few things to note…  Buy one size larger, this shoe comes in smaller than the shoe size.  I wear a size eleven and this size twelve fits perfectly.  My first pair of Puma track/driving shows four years ago.  My first pair of Puma driving shoes lasted for four years of cycling before they started to fall apart.  For cycling (or driving) these shoes are really comfortable, fit great, have great quality, and the Velcro closures solve the only problem I had with my old Puma's - the shoelaces get caught in the bike gears.  I highly recommend this shoe to cyclists and drivers.Last notes…  These are not shoes for anything other than short walking distances – they aren’t designed for walking, they’re designed for driving while seated, and in my case and others cycling while sitting.  And finally, the soles of this shoe can be very slippery when wet so take care.

For cycling (or driving) these shoes are really comfortable, fit great, have great quality, and the Velcro closures solve the only problem I had with my old Puma's - the shoelaces get caught in the bike gears.  I highly recommend this shoe to cyclists and drivers.Last notes…  These are not shoes for anything other than short walking distances – they aren’t designed for walking, they’re designed for driving while seated, and in my case and others cycling while sitting.  And finally, the soles of this shoe can be very slippery when wet so take care.

I checked this out at a local shoe discount store, and then Amazon, and Amazon was $15 less!  These are very comfortable driving shoes, I use them for track days.  The sole is very thin, perfect to feel what is going on with the throttle and brakes, you get great communication, anything less would be just driving with socks.  A great surprise is how soft they are, which allows for ease of bending and more of that communication between feet and pedals on the car.  They are not designed for other things as they have very little cushion.  The only wish I have is they made them from soft leather or canvas.  But can't beat the price for man-made materials.Being Pumas, they run on the smaller and narrower side, just as expected, order the next size up and should be fine unless you regularly use EE shoes, then these won't fit.

I like Puma shoes as they always have unique and sleak designs. These shoes are a bit too small; I mean--my foot fits but it is like wearing a thin piece of cardboard. I like when shoes give me an extra 0.5"" to 1"". These shoes are flat with no elevation whatsoever. Material feels paper thin. It is like almost like wearing socks, not actually sneakers. These are good lightweight shoes if you want to jog around the track but I don't like for casual wear. I like when shoes have a little bit more ""meat"" on them. I bought these to replace my Puma Attaq sneakers but they're not as nice.

I bought these specifically to use on my rower expecting that the fit would be tailored to the positioning of my feet in the stirrups.

PRO: As always, PUMA is at the top of the food chain in Style. Once again that was my purchase choice.Con(s): These Made in Viet Nam shoes are, overall, of poor quality construction.The shoes tongue(s) are roughly sewn in, and leaves a big welt on the top of each foot after a half hours use.The shoes are exceptionally difficult to put on. Once in, these are relatively comfortable (except tongue issue).These are NOT Leather shoes, as we have been used to in years past. Some plastic type upper. Looks like these will crack between toes and foot after minimal wear. Puma Logo is thin glued on decal. Not the leather sewn on decal of old.I did not buy these for every day wear, so they might last for a couple dozen wearing's over the next couple years.

First time I get pumas ,they look better than in the picture, low profile sole but they feel very comfortable, nice leather texture, they feel a bit smaller than the size I ordered 9.5, but considering they are brand new they still need to be broken to my walking habits, the Velcro strap doesn’t go all the way but again I expect for it to flex a bit after certain use, wide fitting a big plus ,over all definitely worth the money . Totally would recommend.

Style-wise these shoes are _everything_. You will turn heads, you will get compliments, without a doubt. But, they are not comfortable. No arch support, no support really at all (so maybe as a driving shoe they are fine), and the leather material isn't supple. But the real problem is they are for very slim feet. 1. I am a woman, 2. I have narrow feet. So if I'm saying it's a tight fit, believe me. That velcro strap is very short, so if you wanted to make it a looser fit, you don't have a lot of leeway to work with. I'm really disappointed. I loved the look top to bottom out of the box, unfortunately they are going back into the box.

Love these shoes.Pros:- Super light weight- Easy to put on and take off- Fit securely once the velcro strap is secured. No worries about them coming off while doing any activity.- Surprisingly durable. I've been wearing them every day, all day, for months and they're still in pretty good shape. They clean up well with a Clorox wipe now and then.Cons:- None. Really.Shoes like this make me wonder why anyone makes shoes with laces. The laces get dirty, then come untied, they break. The velcro on these just works and months later it's still working fine and not threatening to separate or anything like that.

I purchased these to work out in and do martial arts/heavy bag/kicking, etc. I basically wanted something with more protection outdoors rather than going barefoot or using grappling socks. They fit my needs to a ""t""! I usually wear a sneaker size 8 1/2 or 41 euro. They are rather narrower than my 8.5 adidas but still fit fine. In fact I wanted something more of a glove fit. My feet are flat so I usually go with something with less arch support like these. I love them! They slightly lack in breathability since they are synthetic, but I do not wear them all day anyway.

LOVE these shoes!My husband wears them 10+ hours a day, 6 days a week and they are DURABLE!  Great comfort that you expect from PUMA.  The brand is narrow, so be mindful of that when purchasing.  If you have a wide foot - I don't feel PUMA is an ideal brand for you.The PUMA emblem on the shoes we purchased looked perfect.  I read 2 reviews of the emblem coming off - but I had no issues at all.Received so many compliments on these shoes, the price point is AWESOME!  We highly recommend these shoes.

I always like PUMA styling. For this one, it fits my feet. The only complaint I have (which is why it's not 5 star) is that the shoes are rather narrow (but still comfortable), which means it may hurt for long walk day like a day in Disney, for example. But for a weekend stroll through malls and restaurants, the shoes won't be a problem at all for me.If you're looking for a very comfortable shoes for long walk but still stylish, consider something with relaxed fit. This one is not a relaxed fit.

The shoe is nice but the picture is just the teeniest bit deceptive as the area just before the toes is a bit small, the shape of the shoe is more like a triangle than that of a shoe which has kind of an hourglass shape (middle is skinnier than ends) Other than that it looks nice, is super light and overall pretty good

El diseño muy bueno pero el cuero utilizado es sintético y con dos posturas en dos semanas ya se agrieta y el elástico se rompió y lo tuve que mandar a coser (la persona que lo arreglo me dijo que no duraran mucho y que tengo que ponérmelos poco para que duren mas).  Por lo anterior creo que con el tiempo (no le coloco mas de un año) se romperán.  La verdad que en mi Pais venden productos deportivos de cuero a menor precio de este (que considero muy costoso para la calidad de los mismos).Por eso creo que la relación precio/calidad esta mal, deben ser mucho mas económicos.Aun con lo anterior no los recomiendo ya que se romperán muy rápido.

The shoes are awesome, but they fit differently from most Puma shoes that I own. I bought them for martial arts which they work well, although the plastic and velcro could cut or scrape someone.

I’ve purchased this same pair of shoes multiple times over the past 5 years. I’ve continually come back to this shoe since they last a good 5-6 months on the streets and another 5-6 months as good yard work shoes. However, something changed this last time. I purchased the same shoe, in the same size, as I have done for years, but this time they are painful to wear. Sure, they look great as usual, but now they give me blisters and sores. I still have two older pairs in the same size that are more than comfortable, just not clean and in good shape. I’ve given my new shoes two months to ‘break in’, but unfortunately they haven’t gotten better.It’s a sad day, but I’ve accepted the fact that I need to find a new pair shoes for the first time in years.

This tennis shoe is so narrow that I have no idea how these people can fit their foot in this particular style shoe.

Puma?  What the heck are these?  I have several pairs of different puma sneakers and really enjoy the look and comfort of all of them.  I bought these Redon fashion sneakers based on the looks and ease of a Velcro closure...yes i may be getting too lazy to tie sneakers.  I bought my normal puma size of 10.5 but, unfortunately, these Redon fashion sneakers are an anomaly in the puma line.  These run too small, too narrow, the upper material is super-thin, and there is literally little to no sole and/or cushioning.  I bought these for casual wear not for running or working out so my expectations were in line for fashion sneakers but they were just so darn uncomfortable just trying on and walking around the house, I returned them almost immediately.  YMMV but I would not buy these again.

My last 3 pairs of running shoes have been Puma. I liked the look of the shoe when I saw it on Amazon. So I bought it trusting the prior quality I had become accustomed to. Delivery speed was good all things considered. Out of the box they were an utter disappointment. Very lightweight-but not in a good way. The materials were very poor. Low quality vinyl and very thin. Im familiar with synthetics being used instead of leather in places around the shoe. This material was paper thin and easily deformed to the touch. Also it made a crinkling sound when you walked. The toe area was not reinforce at all and deformed after wearing. There were differences in the shoe I got vs what was in the picture. Ex: the stitching around the toe area appears to join two separate pieces of ""leather"" together in the picture. On the shoe I recieved, the toe and top are all one piece and the stitching is there for looks. I strongly believe this is a couterfit shoe or knock-off. Dont buy

I was very impressed by these shoes overall. While I have always loved the aesthetics of PUMA's shoes, my previous pair's build quality left something to be desired.

Bought these shoes because I like the whole look.  After reading reviews I bought a half size larger(normally wear a ten but bought 10 1/2).

I like the original model it replaced because the Velcro is just annoying and makes it hard to be a slip on shoe.  The original elastic worked just fine and I still have the old pair but the white cloth stripes  are wearing out.  The white strips on this one is vinyl so they are easier to clean.
"
20902,"
From the instant I put these shoes on in the morning until I go to bed at night, I am always the coolest person in the room. You can't help but look at my feet as I fly by. I forgot to mention that these shoes make me run fast everywhere I go. Even if I don't want to run there, I run there. Just remember that I look super cool as I run to places that I don't really want to run to.
"

They looked fine (I didn't like the white patch of sole in front of the toes, but its ok).Only problem is size. I am a 10, but bought 10.5 upon reading other reviews.It did not fit. Not just a little tight, I could not walk at all and could see the shape of bent toes from above.Planned to get 11, but found something better looking in the meanwhile

I got a pair a couple of years ago and they're still alive, although a bit scracthed here and there. Got this new pair for a very low price and I'm pretty sure they'll last a couple of years. If you don't like spending too much on a pair of long-lasting sneakers, these are one of the best choices out there.
"
20910,"
I like the shoe but the size is tighter than other brands of the same size.Just try a size bigger will probably work. Or order the wide size if they have it.BTW- they are not lace up like in the description, as you will see in the photos on the site. They have a velcro tab.
"
20911,"
Fit great just what I needed.
"

Love these for working out (weight lifting). You will be close to the ground, without laces to worry about! The only issue is that the velcro starts to lose strength and eventually it will barely hold anymore

They are very comfortable. This shoe is very flat so you have to like that feel as i do. I bought them as an autocross driving shoe and they work great for that. The flat bottom helps to feel the pedals better and aids in heel/toe action.

I like the look and the side strap closure. However, the leather is thin and wrinkles in the toe area.  Understand that-- like all Puma sneakers-- they are somewhat narrow than I would have like.  Overall, however, I'm pleased with the purchase, so far.

Once Puma discontinued the Mostro, I was distraught but this shoe gives me the same comfort of the Mostro.  Although, I would love to have the Mostro back.  Great shoe!

The shoe is narrower than my expectations. It means that you may order a bigger one than your common size.I ordered one and I have refunded it because the small stick on the shoe had a litter flexibility and accordingly the shoe was too tight.

I definitely advise to go a size up from what you normally wear cuz that's what a lot of other people recommended and they fit like a glove so that's what I did I got an 11 instead of a 10 and a half

because the width is so narrow and the strap is so short, you cannot get the strap across to fit comfortable. when you do get the strap across, the shoe becomes too tight

I tried them on as soon as they arrived. Wow. Not even close to my size. When I tried to secure the Velcro to the shoe I had no room to even attempt to secure it and talk about tight. The further I tried to put my foot in the tighter the shoe got.They look nice but I am disappointed that they were not true to size.
"
20969,"
Great looking shoe, fits well, but the velcro strap needs to be much longer. You have to pull it all the way out to get the shoe on, thread it back through once your foot is securely in the shoe and then struggle to get enough of the strap back through to fasten. Design flaw and a half

With the width of these sneakers I don't see how any male over 6 could fit in them.  The width, or lack thereof, is incredibly small.  I couldn't even get my toes in.  Plus I ordered a size up.  The quality is ridiculously low.  These aren't much strong than a cardboard box material.  This is PUMA?

After reading many reviews about shoe sizes, i decided to buy my first shoes online. I own a pair of Pumas, size 11, and took every other reviewers advice and ordered them 1 size larger.

Bought these for my husband as a casual shoe he can wear with jeans and slide on easily to get out the door quickly.  He loves them and they look great!!  He has wider feet, but has had no issues with these being slightly more of a narrow fitting shoe.

This is a Nice, Comfortable, Lightweight shoe!  I'm satisfied and if you've bought Puma before, the size you where in a lace up will fit in this style too.
"
20993,"
You may lose an inch in height wearing these as they have less of a sole than others have, making them feel almost like ballet slippers must feel, but it feels good once you get used to it. There is little cushioning in the sole so they are mainly for casual wear and probably not good for running etc.

Exactly as seen in the picture aside from one thing, no stitching on the heels or front toes holding together the rubber and leather. Don't worry though the glue used is probably more than enough for strength. However in the picture it's either red or grey stitching. I didn't pick the other color because I didn't like the red stitching. Had I known the stitching wasn't there I would have purchased the other shoe.

"

I am and bought a US Size 11. If you have a High In-Step, then do not buy these sneakers. Once I inserted my foot, the sewn-in Velcro strap was not long enough to lace through the hole and secure. For my specific foot, the strap would have needed to be at least a couple of inches longer. Also, I wouldn't recommend buying if you have a wider than average foot.

My husband loves PUMAs most of his shoes are Puma. So when these arrived he was excited that lasted all of 2 secs. These are not up to Puma standards they crease and look worn out in hrs of wearing them. I should have just sent them back but he wore them to work one day for 6 hrs they look yrs old.

Initial impressions: Adorable driving shoes.  I'm pleased with the soles design: thin material allowed toes to feel the pedal location & vibration while the wrap over the heal provides a good pivot for pedal control.The shoes do fit quite narrow, but still work for me.  I was most disappointed to see the model shipped to me does not have any stitching through the soles, unlike the pictured units.

These reviews cracked me up! No one seems to know these are DRIVING SHOES, as in for driving race cars on a track! Lol Why any of you would buy these just to wear around is beyond me. They're freaking ugly! Haha They don't belong on your feet unless you're doing heel/toe downshifts. And for that purpose they are very good for the price!
"
21496,"
these shoes are for sports such as mma, boxing, indoor soccer, and car racing.  the in/bottom soles are thin because it’s practically used to feel the pivot and grip to the ground.  professional boxers and indoor soccer players use the same type of thin in/bottom soles for this ideal use.  i personally use these in the gym and boxing gym, and i can now tell why boxing shoes are made the way they are for performancelikes:- i can feel the grip and the positioning of my feet for maximum impact and mobility- its like being bear footed but with added protection from blisters and cuts from the thin soles-they sound like boots when i walk around in themdislikes:- they will eventually stretch out and lose grip, typically within 6 months of heavy use from athletic training because on its thin quality. but those months will be the greatest gain of performance and strength conditioning.- they’re not for daily wear, you will feel every pebble and cranny under your feet. not painful though- the velcro will wear out eventually
"
21497,"
I bought these on sale directly from Puma's website.These shoes are constructed out of a cheap plastic upper and a sole that is about twice as tick as a credit card.It appears as if they simply lengthened the toe of a smaller pair of shoes to construct larger sizes.If you are any bigger than a man-let these shoes will be too narrow.It's amazing to me that any company would allow there brand to be associated with such a truly crappy product.I hope that whomever made the decision to cut cost and make the shoes out of plastic ultimately loses their job.
"
21498,"
Its definitely a different look...small slim look
"
21499,"
As an owner of multiple pairs of pumas I was planning on purchasing a pair of these in white cuz they look good but after reading the horrible reviews I’ve realized these are crappy fake pumas. I am so glad I didn’t purchase them. You would do well to stay away. Don’t waste your money on these knock-offs.
"

They are better than the average sneakers in that you can walk in them comfortably for around 2 miles. But the width is too narrow and they do not provide any breathing.
"
21501,"
I've been buying puma shoes since I can remember. They've always fit me well and for my size (slim) they do look good on me. This shoe fits so snug and well. It's not to tight and feels so comfortable. I also suffer from flat feet so I might recommend a massage foot insole also. The look of it is so awesome. And for the price can't go wrong.

The shoe does not really have and real comfort for standing for extended periods of time, the instep was pretty tight, and the shoe itself was a bit too narrow.I chalk that up to my foot being a bit wider and taller than most, so if you're a more normal size footed person, this should be pretty good.

"
21534,"
Este fue un regalo a mi mismo, si diseño sin duda es muy atractivo, son muy confortables a pesar de que la suela no es tan gruesa no hace que sientas las piedras de zonas con este tipo de piso. Yo los uso para ir a mi oficina y para salir con mi familia ya que combinan con un look casual

Schuhe sehen prima aus,  nur tragen kann er sie nicht, sind zu eng.
"
21536,"
Muy estéticos, me gustaron mucho, la medida del pie quedó como se había pedido, en cuestión del arco no me molestó como comentan en otros comentarios. El único inconveniente para mí es el estrecho del tenis pero no es culpa del tenis si no es que mis pies son muy amplios.Si son solo para salir no tengo problema, pero si tienes que hacer una actividad física por mucho rato, si siento una incomodidad en la parte lateral del pie, pero en sí, están comodos por la ayuda del velcro que puedes aflojarlo si quieres que queden un poco holgados si es para salir.
"
21537,"
Es un producto cómodo, claro demasiado estético y muy bonito a la vista. Si tienes arco de pie muy pronunciado ni pienses en comprarlo te incomodará mucho y aunque te guste por lo estético tarde que temprano se sentirá que no valió la pena la compra ya que el estilo y por lo que uno compra este tipo de calzado es por la comodidad. En si el producto te hace dudar de su originalidad pero verificando en páginas oficiales efectivamente es original. Punto importante que si tu pie es ancho o algo gordito no es recomendable ya que deformarás rápidamente la estética ya que por el estilo no soporta mucho la presión interna. Duradero no lo sé porque llevo poco tiempo pero tampoco se siente que me vaya a durar más de un año al usarlo seguido. Así que creo que si compramos algo para que sea duradero este no es tu calzado de elección. Este debe de ser para el estilo y tenerlo ocasionalmente. Pero como tennis o calzado del diario creo perderá su funcionalidad muy rapido!
"
21538,"
Die Qualität und Verarbeitung sind gut und ich bin rundum zufrieden.Die eine Sache die erwähnt werden sollte ist, das der Schuh vorne etwas schmalerausfällt. Bei Personen mit breiteren Füssen wird es eng werden.

Anfangs war ich skeptisch, wie bei vielen Bestellungen hier, das es sich um billige Plagiate handelt. Die Skepsis war aber unbegründet.Da ich diese Schuhe schon seit Jahren trage, wusste ich, auf was ich mich einlasse.Sie sind wunderschön, leicht und bequem. Allerdings sind sie schmal, also nicht unbedingt für breite Füße.Bestellt hatte ich Große 44 und bekam auch diese.Da ich absolut begeistert bin, hatte ich mir gleich im Anschluss ein zweites Paar gekauft. Auch diese waren passgenau.Achso: Die Schuhe wurden in der Hälfte der angegebenen Zeit geliefert, bei beiden Bestellungen. Absolut top!Klare Kaufempfehlung!

I guess it’s my fault for not reading the reviews but they aren’t real leather. We have had similar Puma shoes in the past that were great but I’m very disappointed in these. They stink after only a few weeks of my son wearing them. (I really mean it, they STINK!) He’s never had this issue with other shoes.

Love the shoe for many reasons. Very modest flat tread, so it is great for boxing & weight training. Grips just enough when needed. Super comfortable and snug. Surprisingly the one velcro strap is very supportive and hold's your foot tight in place. Most velcro running shoes don't come close to laced shoes, this does. It is also stylish unlike some runners that our mother's or grandmothers would where for comfort. Need I say more. And lastly, I also wear this shoe out and about with jeans as they are very smart looking.

Como siempre, llegaron antes de lo estimado, eso es fantástico.Los tenis son estupendos, me gustaron mucho, y sí, pide tu talla habitual sin problemas,  calzan  a la perfección y son cómodos para caminar distancias regulares.Son fáciles de poner y quitar, son un poco estrechos, y tal vez un poco más en el empeine, pero al final se sienten muy bien.La calidad me parece buena, no les he notado defectos o un desgaste extremo por el uso.Se limpian facilmente.

My first pair of these are 12 years old. They're a bit leaky now so only good for dry days. Once worn in these shoes fit like slippers. They are not heavy working out trainers more the dress variety to go with your jeans. You can use them but they would last as long in heavy sport. These are made for comfort not speed. It is a pity that you can't find them in this country (UK) for decent money. Puma should maybe buck up and start to distribute them again..

Los compré un número más grande de los habitual, conociendo lo estrecho que son este tipo de calzado ya que he tenido otros tenis PUMA similares, por supuesto del largo me queda grande, pero lo más incomodo es el soporte en el arco del píe, es muy, muy corto.

I have been wear Ouma size US10 or 10 1/2,  was suprised that when my 10 1/2  came, it was very tight and I can hemardly wear it.  The material was also unlike usual Puma shoe, hard and uncomfortable PVC. On looking at the overall quality is bad, very poor.  Then it dawn upon me.... IT IS A FAKE.  Very surprised and disappointed.

What you need to know.Pros:1.  The shoe is easy to clean.2.  It looks fairly stylish3.  It hugs your ankle well so it fits to the foot well and isn't loose.4.  It's fairly comfortable not to bad.5.  It's priced fairly good for what your paying.Cons:1.  The shoe materials are some what average, and some parts don't really seem to sturdy in the construction which concerns me already. (The lip in front and sides)2.  SIZING!  I am generally a size 11, however I have a wide foot.  Some people have stated on here it's puma sizing and so you should go a size larger.  This is not correct in my opinion.  First off if you order a size bigger it's simply going to be slightly wider and longer.  However when you put the shoe on, it's going to feel comfortable but your going to have about 3/4 inch extra in the front.  So to correctly get the size that's best for you I recommend only going a size above IF the current size you've been wearing in other shoes is always tight and your toes are cramped in the front of the shoe.  If you find the size your wearing is tight on the sides where the shoe curves in, then just get a wider size.  People have also said that you should order a size larger because it can feel tight on your feet even if it fits, but being the owner of numerous Puma shoes in the past, I've found that after about 1 month the shoes break in and don't feel tight anymore.  So in conclusion if you are normally a size 9,10,11,12 etc then stay with that size and just get a size wider if your concerned about it being a little tight around the curve.  However if your all about maximum comfort then yes go for a size larger so you can have maximum space.

I really like these shoes.  They are similar to driving shoes.  They are very comfortable if you are not going to be walking on uneven ground or something like gravel on a regular basis.  Even when you do walk on surfaces like gravel, the sole is not so thin that it is necessarily uncomfortable.  There isn't much arch support though if you need that in a shoe.  I found the sole and outer upper will separate if you wear them on a daily basis.  After a year it started to slightly separate and I added some ShoeGoo to stop any further progression.  I think they will last for another year and a half at least (they are my primary shoes).My first purchase was early in 2021 and now late in 2022 I have purchased another pair to ensure I will have a pair when the first wears out.  I am always concerned when I find a pair of shoes I like that they will go out of production.  I should be good for the next five years.The fit is about right.  If you have a wide foot it may be problematic.  I have a normal to slightly narrow foot and they fit well for me.

These make great cycling shoes, and I don’t bike long-distance without them!  A few things to note…  Buy one size larger, this shoe comes in smaller than the shoe size.  I wear a size eleven and this size twelve fits perfectly.  My first pair of Puma track/driving shows four years ago.  My first pair of Puma driving shoes lasted for four years of cycling before they started to fall apart.  For cycling (or driving) these shoes are really comfortable, fit great, have great quality, and the Velcro closures solve the only problem I had with my old Puma's - the shoelaces get caught in the bike gears.  I highly recommend this shoe to cyclists and drivers.Last notes…  These are not shoes for anything other than short walking distances – they aren’t designed for walking, they’re designed for driving while seated, and in my case and others cycling while sitting.  And finally, the soles of this shoe can be very slippery when wet so take care.

I checked this out at a local shoe discount store, and then Amazon, and Amazon was $15 less!  These are very comfortable driving shoes, I use them for track days.  The sole is very thin, perfect to feel what is going on with the throttle and brakes, you get great communication, anything less would be just driving with socks.  A great surprise is how soft they are, which allows for ease of bending and more of that communication between feet and pedals on the car.  They are not designed for other things as they have very little cushion.  The only wish I have is they made them from soft leather or canvas.  But can't beat the price for man-made materials.Being Pumas, they run on the smaller and narrower side, just as expected, order the next size up and should be fine unless you regularly use EE shoes, then these won't fit.

I like Puma shoes as they always have unique and sleak designs. These shoes are a bit too small; I mean--my foot fits but it is like wearing a thin piece of cardboard. I like when shoes give me an extra 0.5"" to 1"". These shoes are flat with no elevation whatsoever. Material feels paper thin. It is like almost like wearing socks, not actually sneakers. These are good lightweight shoes if you want to jog around the track but I don't like for casual wear. I like when shoes have a little bit more ""meat"" on them. I bought these to replace my Puma Attaq sneakers but they're not as nice.

I bought these specifically to use on my rower expecting that the fit would be tailored to the positioning of my feet in the stirrups.

"

PRO: As always, PUMA is at the top of the food chain in Style. Once again that was my purchase choice.Con(s): These Made in Viet Nam shoes are, overall, of poor quality construction.The shoes tongue(s) are roughly sewn in, and leaves a big welt on the top of each foot after a half hours use.The shoes are exceptionally difficult to put on. Once in, these are relatively comfortable (except tongue issue).These are NOT Leather shoes, as we have been used to in years past. Some plastic type upper. Looks like these will crack between toes and foot after minimal wear. Puma Logo is thin glued on decal. Not the leather sewn on decal of old.I did not buy these for every day wear, so they might last for a couple dozen wearing's over the next couple years.

First time I get pumas ,they look better than in the picture, low profile sole but they feel very comfortable, nice leather texture, they feel a bit smaller than the size I ordered 9.5, but considering they are brand new they still need to be broken to my walking habits, the Velcro strap doesn’t go all the way but again I expect for it to flex a bit after certain use, wide fitting a big plus ,over all definitely worth the money . Totally would recommend.

Style-wise these shoes are _everything_. You will turn heads, you will get compliments, without a doubt. But, they are not comfortable. No arch support, no support really at all (so maybe as a driving shoe they are fine), and the leather material isn't supple. But the real problem is they are for very slim feet. 1. I am a woman, 2. I have narrow feet. So if I'm saying it's a tight fit, believe me. That velcro strap is very short, so if you wanted to make it a looser fit, you don't have a lot of leeway to work with. I'm really disappointed. I loved the look top to bottom out of the box, unfortunately they are going back into the box.

Love these shoes.Pros:- Super light weight- Easy to put on and take off- Fit securely once the velcro strap is secured. No worries about them coming off while doing any activity.- Surprisingly durable. I've been wearing them every day, all day, for months and they're still in pretty good shape. They clean up well with a Clorox wipe now and then.Cons:- None. Really.Shoes like this make me wonder why anyone makes shoes with laces. The laces get dirty, then come untied, they break. The velcro on these just works and months later it's still working fine and not threatening to separate or anything like that.

the quality of the shoe is better than how it has been shown in the pic in Amazon. I really love it. I was excited when I was unboxing it, after unboxing I was worried whether it would fit for my broad leg but it fits perfectly and the feel when I walk is good that shows the quality of PUMA the brand I love and thanks to Amazon for Genuine PUMA shoes. Though i can't comment on he durability as it is my first day I can be confident about PUMA & Amazon products as is is from Amazon Export Sales.

I purchased these to work out in and do martial arts/heavy bag/kicking, etc. I basically wanted something with more protection outdoors rather than going barefoot or using grappling socks. They fit my needs to a ""t""! I usually wear a sneaker size 8 1/2 or 41 euro. They are rather narrower than my 8.5 adidas but still fit fine. In fact I wanted something more of a glove fit. My feet are flat so I usually go with something with less arch support like these. I love them! They slightly lack in breathability since they are synthetic, but I do not wear them all day anyway.
"
21716,"
LOVE these shoes!My husband wears them 10+ hours a day, 6 days a week and they are DURABLE!  Great comfort that you expect from PUMA.  The brand is narrow, so be mindful of that when purchasing.  If you have a wide foot - I don't feel PUMA is an ideal brand for you.The PUMA emblem on the shoes we purchased looked perfect.  I read 2 reviews of the emblem coming off - but I had no issues at all.Received so many compliments on these shoes, the price point is AWESOME!  We highly recommend these shoes.
"

I always like PUMA styling. For this one, it fits my feet. The only complaint I have (which is why it's not 5 star) is that the shoes are rather narrow (but still comfortable), which means it may hurt for long walk day like a day in Disney, for example. But for a weekend stroll through malls and restaurants, the shoes won't be a problem at all for me.If you're looking for a very comfortable shoes for long walk but still stylish, consider something with relaxed fit. This one is not a relaxed fit.

The shoe is nice but the picture is just the teeniest bit deceptive as the area just before the toes is a bit small, the shape of the shoe is more like a triangle than that of a shoe which has kind of an hourglass shape (middle is skinnier than ends) Other than that it looks nice, is super light and overall pretty good

El diseño muy bueno pero el cuero utilizado es sintético y con dos posturas en dos semanas ya se agrieta y el elástico se rompió y lo tuve que mandar a coser (la persona que lo arreglo me dijo que no duraran mucho y que tengo que ponérmelos poco para que duren mas).  Por lo anterior creo que con el tiempo (no le coloco mas de un año) se romperán.  La verdad que en mi Pais venden productos deportivos de cuero a menor precio de este (que considero muy costoso para la calidad de los mismos).Por eso creo que la relación precio/calidad esta mal, deben ser mucho mas económicos.Aun con lo anterior no los recomiendo ya que se romperán muy rápido.

The shoes are awesome, but they fit differently from most Puma shoes that I own. I bought them for martial arts which they work well, although the plastic and velcro could cut or scrape someone.

I’ve purchased this same pair of shoes multiple times over the past 5 years. I’ve continually come back to this shoe since they last a good 5-6 months on the streets and another 5-6 months as good yard work shoes. However, something changed this last time. I purchased the same shoe, in the same size, as I have done for years, but this time they are painful to wear. Sure, they look great as usual, but now they give me blisters and sores. I still have two older pairs in the same size that are more than comfortable, just not clean and in good shape. I’ve given my new shoes two months to ‘break in’, but unfortunately they haven’t gotten better.It’s a sad day, but I’ve accepted the fact that I need to find a new pair shoes for the first time in years. I’ll miss what these shoes once were...

This tennis shoe is so narrow that I have no idea how these people can fit their foot in this particular style shoe. If you look at the picture of the bottom of the shoe you can tell how little room you have for your foot. It’s extremely narrow no matter what size shoe you buy. I love wearing Puma’s, but these were terrible.

Shoes received are a half size smaller than what I ordered. Chose to just live with it but the shoes become unbearable after a couple hours. Other than that, they are exactly what I wanted and they look great.

For a narrow foot and no support at all maybe a good driving shoe?

Quality is not great, hence the low price. I typically wear a 10 or a 9.5 W. So i ordered 10.5. The width and length were fine, but i could not close the top velcro. Why make it so short?... do not recommend. I can tell a few other people tried it on already since the right shoe was wrinkled, but left was brand new. Passing on Puma shoes going forward...

I use these for martial arts training. They are great for this purpose! At least for me they are. I do not use them for any other activity. I recommend them to any martial artist no matter what the discipline. Especially, sport Karate point fighting but even a grappling sport like Jiu-Jitsu.Barefoot training is great and frankly I prefer it but my toes have been jammed so many times on the mats while barefoot. These shoes help prevent that. Buy with confidence. They are under $50.00 so if you do not like them no big loss. Thanks.

Order half size bigger...shoes is a bit smaller than the size I wear. I got a replacement right away and this time it just fits fine, a half size bigger. The material is soft and style is great even without socks. I just have a bit of a concern of the straps...it might not last long.

Puma?  What the heck are these?  I have several pairs of different puma sneakers and really enjoy the look and comfort of all of them.  I bought these Redon fashion sneakers based on the looks and ease of a Velcro closure...yes i may be getting too lazy to tie sneakers.  I bought my normal puma size of 10.5 but, unfortunately, these Redon fashion sneakers are an anomaly in the puma line.  These run too small, too narrow, the upper material is super-thin, and there is literally little to no sole and/or cushioning.  I bought these for casual wear not for running or working out so my expectations were in line for fashion sneakers but they were just so darn uncomfortable just trying on and walking around the house, I returned them almost immediately.  YMMV but I would not buy these again.
"

My last 3 pairs of running shoes have been Puma. I liked the look of the shoe when I saw it on Amazon. So I bought it trusting the prior quality I had become accustomed to. Delivery speed was good all things considered. Out of the box they were an utter disappointment. Very lightweight-but not in a good way. The materials were very poor. Low quality vinyl and very thin. Im familiar with synthetics being used instead of leather in places around the shoe. This material was paper thin and easily deformed to the touch. Also it made a crinkling sound when you walked. The toe area was not reinforce at all and deformed after wearing. There were differences in the shoe I got vs what was in the picture. Ex: the stitching around the toe area appears to join two separate pieces of ""leather"" together in the picture. On the shoe I recieved, the toe and top are all one piece and the stitching is there for looks. I strongly believe this is a couterfit shoe or knock-off. Dont buy

The Puma product is great and the different product lines offered by Amazon is second to none; however, your political views against Christianity has caused me to order products from other sources, even though inconvenient for me. I am willing to vote with my money. I pray that Amazon changes and becomes more like the values America was founded upon.
"
21752,"
Shoes seems OK,  but I returned them.  Amazon suggested a size 13.  I have another pair of Puma that are size 13 and fit really well.  But these were at least 1 inch or so to big, big enough that it felt like I would be falling on my face if I tried to wear these.

This is my second pair of these. I love them. The other pair was still in good shape after over a year (worn evenings and weekends mostly), but got soaked in the rain I couldn't get them dry fast enough so they started smelling.

I was very impressed by these shoes overall. While I have always loved the aesthetics of PUMA's shoes, my previous pair's build quality left something to be desired. This pair of shoes however, has proven to be a different story. My Redon's have kept up well despite being worn basically everyday since I bought them. The only real negative thing I can say about these shoes is that the arch support is a tad bit lacking...but that is what you get when you go for a shoe of this design.
"
21760,"
Bought these shoes because I like the whole look.  After reading reviews I bought a half size larger(normally wear a ten but bought 10 1/2).  Have had them for about one month and they are my go to shoe.  Way comfortable and feel like wearing a glove for my feet.  I among a bit concerned about the Velcro strap as I am afraid it will lose its grip after multiple uses but so far so good.  Very comfortable to wear when driving long distances or traveling.I will definitely get another pair when these wear out assuming they hold up adequately.
"

The toe was very narrow and the material is very soft

These are more like slippers rather than tennis shoes.  Not much to them.  No arch support, and not much of a sole.  They are fairly nice looking, simulated leather, but very light weight.  Not sure about wearing them outside, I think you would feel every stone.  And if it's wet out, the soles are so thin, I think you'll have wet socks.

Am familiar with these shoes, know from earlier pairs to order 1/2 size larger for them to fit because they run on the small side. They are great lightweight shoes for gym, only negative is velcro closure can be a little weak and open up under stress.
"

These shoes are about half a size smaller than what I typically wear, after reading the previous reviews I ordered 9.5 instead of 9 that I usually buy and it fits just right (so going up half the size seems to be the right approach).

My feet are slightly different sizes, but I'm able to adjust thanks to the velcro. I have zero sense of style, but I think these shoes look completely kick-butt. Plus, if you live in a country where you have to take your shoes off all the time, these are a life-saver.

I ordered my usual size and found them to be a little snug. I hope in time they will stretch. The soles tend to stick to the mat with a high frictionlevel.

I wasn't sure how it would fit, since I am a size 10 in women. But it feels great, the only drawback is that I cannot fasten it across the top, but it is pretty snug, so it will not fall off.  Would purchase from the seller again!

I like the original model it replaced because the Velcro is just annoying and makes it hard to be a slip on shoe.  The original elastic worked just fine and I still have the old pair but the white cloth stripes  are wearing out.  The white strips on this one is vinyl so they are easier to clean.

From the instant I put these shoes on in the morning until I go to bed at night, I am always the coolest person in the room. You can't help but look at my feet as I fly by.

You may lose an inch in height wearing these as they have less of a sole than others have, making them feel almost like ballet slippers must feel, but it feels good once you get used to it.

I selected ""somewhat narrow"" but with within 3 day I have reached ""As expected"" when it comes to good fit. Love these shows
"

Looks the part, good price, wears well (both sole and leather exterior), dirt and water resistant, width is good - but length is a little on the short side, I find (this pair and the previous season's version).
"
21891,"
Nice shoe. Looks great.Very thin upper and sole. I would consider this more of a 'fashion slipper' than a shoe.Fits slightly smaller than sized.
"
21892,"
Comfortable, easily cleaned shoe.  I dont anticpate they will last an incredibly long time as sold is on the thing side.  I also would not use them for heavy running.  Great looking comfortable and i love the velcro..no tie!

I get lots of compliments on these shoes, they look great.Too bad they are pretty narrow and don't fit well. Not comfortable shoes.

These puma men's redon are great. Atheletic but yet casually dressy. I wear them to go out at night in NYC with a nice pair of jean. They are slick!
"

Its puma I've always had great luck with pumas quality I would recommend buying it a little bigger than needed
"
21898,"
Shoe fits but you cannot strap it up.Shoe is cut narrow, increased up one size and cannot strap the velcro. So, these will have to go back.
"
21899,"
Looks great feels great! I had them 2 weeks and ordered a second pair in white too
"
21900,"
Exactly as seen in the picture aside from one thing, no stitching on the heels or front toes holding together the rubber and leather. Don't worry though the glue used is probably more than enough for strength. However in the picture it's either red or grey stitching. I didn't pick the other color because I didn't like the red stitching. Had I known the stitching wasn't there I would have purchased the other shoe.
"
21901,"
Nice Shoes! A little bit bigger than I expected tho.

The shoes are nice,  if you like the sleek smoothie look.  The strap doesn't quite get them tight enough. They don't have the same cradel tight fit I've come to expect from puma.  They are okay, I will opt for lace up next time.

Puma has not let me down yet. Neither has Amazon. The shoes are amazing. They fit snug like all puma shoes do and I like that.  I have gotten a lot of compliments about my shoes witch just re-enforce my  decision on buying the shoes.
"
21908,"
They are puma shoes , the label says US13 ,but these shoes are far from being a 13 , there more like a size 11, I'm done with Amazon, ebay,wish and will never order another piece of clothing online again, I dont have time for returns,  I ordered a 13, I know any size 13 fits, these shoes are not a 13, plus there narrow as hell, the toe is the same width as the heal.
"

These run really small and are narrow. I had to send them back for two sizes larger. They are comfortable and light.
"

The shoes were 100% Ok but a little bit too small so I had to send them back, it was not a problem I got the refund
"
21911,"
This is one of my favorite all time shoes. I bought a few other color options and wear them everyday. I couldn't snap them so get a size larger. But if you unhook the velcro, they are perfect slip ons which is how I wear them.

Ordered these shoes to wear for driving and playing the drums. They are amazing. I ordered them about 1/2 a size smaller than what I normally wear in tennis shoes hoping that they would be just a little snug. Should have just ordered my normal size!
"
21925,"
I am and bought a US Size 11. If you have a High In-Step, then do not buy these sneakers. Once I inserted my foot, the sewn-in Velcro strap was not long enough to lace through the hole and secure. For my specific foot, the strap would have needed to be at least a couple of inches longer. Also, I wouldn't recommend buying if you have a wider than average foot.
"
21926,"
My husband loves PUMAs most of his shoes are Puma. So when these arrived he was excited that lasted all of 2 secs. These are not up to Puma standards they crease and look worn out in hrs of wearing them. I should have just sent them back but he wore them to work one day for 6 hrs they look yrs old. Do not buy these shoes you will regret it I wish I had paid attention to the reviews more. Amazon shouldn’t be selling these shoes they are that bad.

Use these for biking, with a TREK FX 7.4  as they are easily slip into the toe clips....You do  have to tug a bit on the strap to make sure it locks onto to the velcro. These shoes are very soff and comfortable

Love these shoes. Not the best support for long term walking, but they look and feel great.
"
21934,"
I checked the reviews before buying them. My shoes size always 9.5, but I took 10 as reviewers advise. It is exactly what I expected. But you have to wait 2 to 3 times to be fit in your foot.

Del. Was great shoes fit good but haven't wore them for any length of time.

Typically, Puma is my go to shoe/sneaker.  Not these. The worst ever. ZERO support. After 10 minutes I had to remove them due to cramping.  I will be returning these stat.  Very disappointing as all of my other Pumas have been terrific, especially the Tazon 6 FM’s.  (White/black/silver). I buy them like candy-so comfortable right out of the box. Never misses. Usually wait for sale and load up.

"
21960,"
The Velcro e belt is too small to go over the foot arch
"
21961,"
The shoes are hard to put on due to small access for foot to enter the shoe.  Also the Velcro tongue to fasten them is too short to pull through and fasten easily.  I have two other pair of another type of Puma shoe.  I wouldn't buy another pair of this type of Puma shoe.

I have three pair.  I just love these shoes.
"
21964,"
I really wanted to like these shoes, but they are incredibly narrow. In addition, they are not made of leather, but synthetic. There were some scuffs on the front of the shoes when I received them, and the Puma on the side seemed ironed on, and can imagine that it would come off as another reviewer experienced. For the price, I would spend my money on a pair of Adidas martial arts shoes.
"
21965,"
Great for the price.  I use in my kickboxing class.

I always by pumas but these where the first pair I bought with the Velcro strap. The Velcro strap doesn't have much adjustment for the tightness you would  prefer. So the shoes are comfortable but are a little tight cause of the strap

Initial impressions: Adorable driving shoes.  I'm pleased with the soles design: thin material allowed toes to feel the pedal location & vibration while the wrap over the heal provides a good pivot for pedal control.The shoes do fit quite narrow, but still work for me.

These reviews cracked me up! No one seems to know these are DRIVING SHOES, as in for driving race cars on a track! Lol Why any of you would buy these just to wear around is beyond me. They're freaking ugly! Haha They don't belong on your feet unless you're doing heel/toe downshifts. And for that purpose they are very good for the price!
"
22380,"
these shoes are for sports such as mma, boxing, indoor soccer, and car racing.  the in/bottom soles are thin because it’s practically used to feel the pivot and grip to the ground.  professional boxers and indoor soccer players use the same type of thin in/bottom soles for this ideal use.  i personally use these in the gym and boxing gym, and i can now tell why boxing shoes are made the way they are for performancelikes:- i can feel the grip and the positioning of my feet for maximum impact and mobility- its like being bear footed but with added protection from blisters and cuts from the thin soles-they sound like boots when i walk around in themdislikes:- they will eventually stretch out and lose grip, typically within 6 months of heavy use from athletic training because on its thin quality. but those months will be the greatest gain of performance and strength conditioning.- they’re not for daily wear, you will feel every pebble and cranny under your feet. not painful though- the velcro will wear out eventually
"
22381,"
I bought these on sale directly from Puma's website.These shoes are constructed out of a cheap plastic upper and a sole that is about twice as tick as a credit card.It appears as if they simply lengthened the toe of a smaller pair of shoes to construct larger sizes.If you are any bigger than a man-let these shoes will be too narrow.It's amazing to me that any company would allow there brand to be associated with such a truly crappy product.I hope that whomever made the decision to cut cost and make the shoes out of plastic ultimately loses their job.
"
22382,"
Its definitely a different look...small slim look
"
22383,"
As an owner of multiple pairs of pumas I was planning on purchasing a pair of these in white cuz they look good but after reading the horrible reviews I’ve realized these are crappy fake pumas. I am so glad I didn’t purchase them. You would do well to stay away. Don’t waste your money on these knock-offs.
"
22384,"
They are better than the average sneakers in that you can walk in them comfortably for around 2 miles. But the width is too narrow and they do not provide any breathing.
"
22385,"
I've been buying puma shoes since I can remember. They've always fit me well and for my size (slim) they do look good on me. This shoe fits so snug and well. It's not to tight and feels so comfortable. I also suffer from flat feet so I might recommend a massage foot insole also. The look of it is so awesome. And for the price can't go wrong.

The shoe does not really have and real comfort for standing for extended periods of time, the instep was pretty tight, and the shoe itself was a bit too narrow.I chalk that up to my foot being a bit wider and taller than most, so if you're a more normal size footed person, this should be pretty good.

Este fue un regalo a mi mismo, si diseño sin duda es muy atractivo, son muy confortables a pesar de que la suela no es tan gruesa no hace que sientas las piedras de zonas con este tipo de piso. Yo los uso para ir a mi oficina y para salir con mi familia ya que combinan con un look casual

Muy estéticos, me gustaron mucho, la medida del pie quedó como se había pedido, en cuestión del arco no me molestó como comentan en otros comentarios. El único inconveniente para mí es el estrecho del tenis pero no es culpa del tenis si no es que mis pies son muy amplios.Si son solo para salir no tengo problema, pero si tienes que hacer una actividad física por mucho rato, si siento una incomodidad en la parte lateral del pie, pero en sí, están comodos por la ayuda del velcro que puedes aflojarlo si quieres que queden un poco holgados si es para salir.
"
22421,"
Es un producto cómodo, claro demasiado estético y muy bonito a la vista. Si tienes arco de pie muy pronunciado ni pienses en comprarlo te incomodará mucho y aunque te guste por lo estético tarde que temprano se sentirá que no valió la pena la compra ya que el estilo y por lo que uno compra este tipo de calzado es por la comodidad. En si el producto te hace dudar de su originalidad pero verificando en páginas oficiales efectivamente es original. Punto importante que si tu pie es ancho o algo gordito no es recomendable ya que deformarás rápidamente la estética ya que por el estilo no soporta mucho la presión interna. Duradero no lo sé porque llevo poco tiempo pero tampoco se siente que me vaya a durar más de un año al usarlo seguido. Así que creo que si compramos algo para que sea duradero este no es tu calzado de elección. Este debe de ser para el estilo y tenerlo ocasionalmente. Pero como tennis o calzado del diario creo perderá su funcionalidad muy rapido!

Anfangs war ich skeptisch, wie bei vielen Bestellungen hier, das es sich um billige Plagiate handelt. Die Skepsis war aber unbegründet.Da ich diese Schuhe schon seit Jahren trage, wusste ich, auf was ich mich einlasse.Sie sind wunderschön, leicht und bequem. Allerdings sind sie schmal, also nicht unbedingt für breite Füße.Bestellt hatte ich Große 44 und bekam auch diese.Da ich absolut begeistert bin, hatte ich mir gleich im Anschluss ein zweites Paar gekauft. Auch diese waren passgenau.Achso: Die Schuhe wurden in der Hälfte der angegebenen Zeit geliefert, bei beiden Bestellungen. Absolut top!Klare Kaufempfehlung!

I guess it’s my fault for not reading the reviews but they aren’t real leather. We have had similar Puma shoes in the past that were great but I’m very disappointed in these. They stink after only a few weeks of my son wearing them. (I really mean it, they STINK!) He’s never had this issue with other shoes.

Love the shoe for many reasons. Very modest flat tread, so it is great for boxing & weight training. Grips just enough when needed. Super comfortable and snug. Surprisingly the one velcro strap is very supportive and hold's your foot tight in place. Most velcro running shoes don't come close to laced shoes, this does. It is also stylish unlike some runners that our mother's or grandmothers would where for comfort. Need I say more. And lastly, I also wear this shoe out and about with jeans as they are very smart looking.

Como siempre, llegaron antes de lo estimado, eso es fantástico.Los tenis son estupendos, me gustaron mucho, y sí, pide tu talla habitual sin problemas,  calzan  a la perfección y son cómodos para caminar distancias regulares.Son fáciles de poner y quitar, son un poco estrechos, y tal vez un poco más en el empeine, pero al final se sienten muy bien.La calidad me parece buena, no les he notado defectos o un desgaste extremo por el uso.Se limpian facilmente.

My first pair of these are 12 years old. They're a bit leaky now so only good for dry days. Once worn in these shoes fit like slippers. They are not heavy working out trainers more the dress variety to go with your jeans. You can use them but they would last as long in heavy sport. These are made for comfort not speed. It is a pity that you can't find them in this country (UK) for decent money. Puma should maybe buck up and start to distribute them again..

Los compré un número más grande de los habitual, conociendo lo estrecho que son este tipo de calzado ya que he tenido otros tenis PUMA similares, por supuesto del largo me queda grande, pero lo más incomodo es el soporte en el arco del píe, es muy, muy corto.

PUMA Men's Pacer Future Sneaker has very poor design upon upper foot entry. It is almost impossible to enter, fit,  foot in, the entry point is too narrow, restricted, and constricting. You need a very slim, small foot or a very strong shoehorn to be able to introduce your foot in, as it does not have a front or back pull strap or loop. Once you are able to insert and fit your foot in the shoe sneaker is comfortable, it snugs, hugs your foot, all around, tightly, but secure, providing good arch and ankle support. It is good for street, asphalt running, daily street, hard surface walking. I seriously doubt recommending this Puma shoe for everyone; it needs to be the right person, with the right size foot to be able to fit it in. The size is the correct one (10) once your foot is in. This design issue is not about size, but of port of entry fitting.

"

PUMA Men's Pacer Future Sneaker has very poor design upon upper foot entry. It is almost impossible to enter, fit,  foot in, the entry point is too narrow, restricted, and constricting. You need a very slim, small foot or a very strong shoehorn to be able to introduce your foot in, as it does not have a front or back pull strap or loop. Once you are able to insert and fit your foot in the shoe sneaker is comfortable, it snugs, hugs your foot, all around, tightly, but secure, providing good arch and ankle support. It is good for street, asphalt running, daily street, hard surface walking. I seriously doubt recommending this Puma shoe for everyone; it needs to be the right person, with the right size foot to be able to fit it in. The size is the correct one (10) once your foot is in. This design issue is not about size, but of port of entry fitting.

These provide good support for my daughter who's had heel problems. They are very stylish, too. We were nervous at first because it says men sizes, but the 5 & 5.5 are still your basic youth sizes..

Its a great looking shoe but instead of a straight lace up, it has a sleeve that you fit your foot into and then lace. However, the sleeve isn't stretchy so its a pain to get your foot in it.

I don't get any sharp pains in my upper back between my shoulder blades midway through the night like a normally did while working on 3rd shift.

I usually order my shoes as size 7.5 US, wide if offered. I have short, wide feet. The usual size 8, the smallest size that retail stores stock, are just big enough to be floppy on me. This is my first shoe with ""spike less"" sole. I guess no more replacing cleats; when the built-in cleats that are part of the sole are worn flat, you don't have any traction, and it'll be time to replace the shoes. I've had friends that use this brand, with the same spike less, and they tend to get about 3 hard seasons out of them. We play right at 50 rounds per year, rarely missing more than 1 week at a time due to weather or family, then we usually make that week up with a multi-day outing!

I was debating whether I should buy these or not. I have had bad experiences with Puma before. I have wide feet and the Pumas from before was way too narrow. Now fast forward and I was in need of better golf shoes that were wide enough. At first, these looked too narrow when the package arrived but once I put it on and started swinging the clubs. I was impressed. I do not want squishy AIR soles. I want a sole that can react to the ground as I push up. These modern Nike shoes are way too squishy. For the money, these are not too bad

I couldn't decide whether to give these shoes 3 or 4 stars but gave them the higher number.  When I first looked at these shoes up close, I discovered that they don't have a tongue.  I've never seen athletic shoes like that.  It's all built in one piece, which could create a problem if the shoelace breaks.  When I first tried to put them on, I found it impossible, so thought they were too small and had to be returned.  However, I had a big shoehorn and got them on with some effort.  Once on they fit perfectly and felt like slippers, only with excellent tread.  I've enjoyed walking around in them, but doubt if they'd hold up walking 18 holes.  I will try them the next time I cut my grass and see what happens.  The styling is unique if you want to try something different.  That's about all I can say until I've worn them longer.

perfect white golf shoes to walk during the hot summer. I bought the white ones and yes they do get dirty like all white shoes, especially considering where these go. Grass, dirt, sand, etc. do NOT buy white shoes if you are going to complain when they get dirty. Like all white shoes, they are high maintenance. I clean them when I get home and wash them every 3-4 uses. so far they are staying very white, but that's what it takes.The shoes are great they are comfortable, light weight, and good-looking. if you are looking for a summer shoe to walk in, these are it. I have spiked waterproof shoes that are great but boy do they get hot when walking 18 during the summer.I highly recommend these and I'm actually considering buy another pair maybe the black ones for when Im feeling lazy and don't want to spot clean after a round.

They’re really comfortable shoes and the traction is good in good conditions (i.e. dry tee box and fairway grass in good shape). I live in the desert and sometimes the grass can dry out and become brittle, especially when they’re changing over, and the traction just isn’t good enough. It’s also iffy when the grass is a little wet the day after a storm or from morning dew.I don’t use them to play anymore, but they are great when on the days when I’m just practicing  around the putting green and working on my wedges.

Good fit, good value, and excellent quality. Golf shoes are always a trade off between comfort and stability, and these shoes pull it off very well. They're so comfortable I have forgotten to change back into my regular shoes after the round before driving home. One star taken off due to them being the most difficult shoes to put on I have ever encountered. There is no tongue, so the opening you have to push your foot through is very small. In addition, there is a weird mechanism that keeps the laces tight making widening the opening even harder. Overall, though, a great golf shoe.Edit: I am changing my rating up to a 5 star having found that, using a shoehorn, these shoes are actually very easy to put on. Without doubt the most comfortable golf shoes I have ever worn.

The wide size fit great, especially when walking 18 holes. They are light weight, comparable to the weight of Sketcher golf shoes.

Fit so well, I bought a 2nd pair of another color.

I love my new golf course kicks. Great footbed (my feet get tired after about 15 holes of walking). Style is great looking. My only complaint is the “slip-on” design is challenging to get on your feet. The tongue is fixed so you can’t pull it back to make more room for slipping your foot in.

Love the shoes and color is awesome. I love walking when possible. The issue i had with previous brands is they never had any options for slightly wider feet and they always felt stiff. With these shoes I feel more comfortable and connected to the ground. If you enjoy a light shoe and like walking the course from time to time, I highly recommend these. The other amazing thing is they are not over priced like a lot of the high end versions. The quality could easily be higher priced, but puma did great in maintaining a high quality shoe for a great price. I get so comfortable in these that sometimes I forget to switch back to my normal shoes after a round. Highly recommend. Hit em straight!!

Tried the new shoes out yesterday and overall am pleased. Had a similar pair of Pumas I really liked, but are no longer available so I got this pair. Lacing really stays in place but removal takes a few minutes. Biggest issue I had was my socklets needed to be pulled up every so often because they would get pulled down at the heel. Never had this problem with other Puma shoes and it may become a bigger problem going forward. Full socks may work better, but we still have many warm days left and I won't wear a full sock with shorts.

I love the look of these shoes, some of the better looking golf shoes in my opinion.

If you have a wide foot, I'm 12.5 W, this shoe is almost impossible to slip on, even with a shoe horn it was too much of a struggle to get the shoe on. Shoe doesn't have a tongue, just a opening on the top that is not adjustable. Donated to Goodwill.

After playing in my old FJ shoes for 5 years that were giving out on me I thought I would give these Puma shoes a shot. They are lightweight and very comfortable. They are spikeless which is what I prefer. I hope they hold up for as long as me previous shoes did. Don't hesitate to try these Pumas.

i generally purchase new balance shoes b/c they come in wide widths.  I was excited when i found this shoe advertised as a ""wide"" shoe.  this is NOT wide at all.  i couldn't even get my foot in.  it's  a great looking shoe but just not wide.  be aware

This is a nice looking shoe but it is very difficult to put on if you have a wide foot.  The tongue is not really a tongue but attached to the sides as well as the base., which leaves a very small opening.  I also found the wide width to be too narrow.

Tried the adidas’s first. Use the try before you buy from Amazon. Saved me from buying some really bad shoes. The puma son the other hand, are absolutely amazing. Very light, feel great! Can walk in public and are just like regular shoes. But also grip great on the grass. Played a few rounds with these and haven’t slipped once in them. Feel like memory foam around you’re feet. Great shoes!
"

Very comfortable shoe. I wear a men's 12 D in all my shoes, boots, etc. My Nike and Footjoy golf shoes are a 12 but the 12 in these had zero toe room so I exchanged for a 12.5 and they were perfect. Nice to have a half size above a 12 as 13's are always too big.

It's hard to find golf shoes in wide widths...particularly when your foot is both short and wide, like mine is. I tried the Fusion Evos in a few sizes, but the bigger issue is that the soles felt...weird. I can't quite explain it, but they just didn't feel like they'd be comfortable and supportive for 18 holes.I also didn't find them to be the most aesthetically pleasing shoes. I liked them more in the photos than in hand.

I usually order my shoes as size 7.5 US, wide if offered. I have short, wide feet. The usual size 8, the smallest size that retail stores stock, are just big enough to be floppy on me. This is my first shoe with ""spike less"" sole. I guess no more replacing cleats; when the built-in cleats that are part of the sole are worn flat, you don't have any traction, and it'll be time to replace the shoes. I've had friends that use this brand, with the same spike less, and they tend to get about 3 hard seasons out of them. We play right at 50 rounds per year, rarely missing more than 1 week at a time due to weather or family, then we usually make that week up with a multi-day outing!
"
22841,"
I was debating whether I should buy these or not. I have had bad experiences with Puma before. I have wide feet and the Pumas from before was way too narrow. Now fast forward and I was in need of better golf shoes that were wide enough. At first, these looked too narrow when the package arrived but once I put it on and started swinging the clubs. I was impressed. I do not want squishy AIR soles. I want a sole that can react to the ground as I push up. These modern Nike shoes are way too squishy. For the money, these are not too bad
"
22842,"
I couldn't decide whether to give these shoes 3 or 4 stars but gave them the higher number.  When I first looked at these shoes up close, I discovered that they don't have a tongue.  I've never seen athletic shoes like that.  It's all built in one piece, which could create a problem if the shoelace breaks.  When I first tried to put them on, I found it impossible, so thought they were too small and had to be returned.  However, I had a big shoehorn and got them on with some effort.  Once on they fit perfectly and felt like slippers, only with excellent tread.  I've enjoyed walking around in them, but doubt if they'd hold up walking 18 holes.  I will try them the next time I cut my grass and see what happens.  The styling is unique if you want to try something different.  That's about all I can say until I've worn them longer.

perfect white golf shoes to walk during the hot summer. I bought the white ones and yes they do get dirty like all white shoes, especially considering where these go. Grass, dirt, sand, etc. do NOT buy white shoes if you are going to complain when they get dirty. Like all white shoes, they are high maintenance. I clean them when I get home and wash them every 3-4 uses. so far they are staying very white, but that's what it takes.The shoes are great they are comfortable, light weight, and good-looking. if you are looking for a summer shoe to walk in, these are it. I have spiked waterproof shoes that are great but boy do they get hot when walking 18 during the summer.I highly recommend these and I'm actually considering buy another pair maybe the black ones for when Im feeling lazy and don't want to spot clean after a round.

They’re really comfortable shoes and the traction is good in good conditions (i.e. dry tee box and fairway grass in good shape). I live in the desert and sometimes the grass can dry out and become brittle, especially when they’re changing over, and the traction just isn’t good enough. It’s also iffy when the grass is a little wet the day after a storm or from morning dew.I don’t use them to play anymore, but they are great when on the days when I’m just practicing  around the putting green and working on my wedges.
"

Good fit, good value, and excellent quality. Golf shoes are always a trade off between comfort and stability, and these shoes pull it off very well. They're so comfortable I have forgotten to change back into my regular shoes after the round before driving home. One star taken off due to them being the most difficult shoes to put on I have ever encountered. There is no tongue, so the opening you have to push your foot through is very small. In addition, there is a weird mechanism that keeps the laces tight making widening the opening even harder. Overall, though, a great golf shoe.Edit: I am changing my rating up to a 5 star having found that, using a shoehorn, these shoes are actually very easy to put on. Without doubt the most comfortable golf shoes I have ever worn.

The wide size fit great, especially when walking 18 holes. They are light weight, comparable to the weight of Sketcher golf shoes.

Fit so well, I bought a 2nd pair of another color.

I love my new golf course kicks. Great footbed (my feet get tired after about 15 holes of walking). Style is great looking. My only complaint is the “slip-on” design is challenging to get on your feet. The tongue is fixed so you can’t pull it back to make more room for slipping your foot in.

Love the shoes and color is awesome. I love walking when possible. The issue i had with previous brands is they never had any options for slightly wider feet and they always felt stiff. With these shoes I feel more comfortable and connected to the ground. If you enjoy a light shoe and like walking the course from time to time, I highly recommend these. The other amazing thing is they are not over priced like a lot of the high end versions. The quality could easily be higher priced, but puma did great in maintaining a high quality shoe for a great price. I get so comfortable in these that sometimes I forget to switch back to my normal shoes after a round. Highly recommend. Hit em straight!!

Tried the new shoes out yesterday and overall am pleased. Had a similar pair of Pumas I really liked, but are no longer available so I got this pair. Lacing really stays in place but removal takes a few minutes. Biggest issue I had was my socklets needed to be pulled up every so often because they would get pulled down at the heel. Never had this problem with other Puma shoes and it may become a bigger problem going forward. Full socks may work better, but we still have many warm days left and I won't wear a full sock with shorts.

I love the look of these shoes, some of the better looking golf shoes in my opinion. That said, after walking 18 holes in these my feet are absolutely trashed, sore, blistered on the bottom because these have terrible insoles.

If you have a wide foot, I'm 12.5 W, this shoe is almost impossible to slip on, even with a shoe horn it was too much of a struggle to get the shoe on. Shoe doesn't have a tongue, just a opening on the top that is not adjustable. Donated to Goodwill.

Fits WAY TO SMALL. I ordered a size 11 and they felt like they were strangling my feet. Trying a size 12, I might even need a 12.5. Order ATLEAST a size larger than you normally are.

After playing in my old FJ shoes for 5 years that were giving out on me I thought I would give these Puma shoes a shot. They are lightweight and very comfortable. They are spikeless which is what I prefer. I hope they hold up for as long as me previous shoes did. Don't hesitate to try these Pumas.

i generally purchase new balance shoes b/c they come in wide widths.  I was excited when i found this shoe advertised as a ""wide"" shoe.  this is NOT wide at all.  i couldn't even get my foot in.  it's  a great looking shoe but just not wide.  be aware

This is a nice looking shoe but it is very difficult to put on if you have a wide foot.  The tongue is not really a tongue but attached to the sides as well as the base., which leaves a very small opening.  I also found the wide width to be too narrow.

Tried the adidas’s first. Use the try before you buy from Amazon. Saved me from buying some really bad shoes. The puma son the other hand, are absolutely amazing. Very light, feel great! Can walk in public and are just like regular shoes. But also grip great on the grass. Played a few rounds with these and haven’t slipped once in them. Feel like memory foam around you’re feet. Great shoes!
"

Very comfortable shoe. I wear a men's 12 D in all my shoes, boots, etc. My Nike and Footjoy golf shoes are a 12 but the 12 in these had zero toe room so I exchanged for a 12.5 and they were perfect. Nice to have a half size above a 12 as 13's are always too big.
"

Love the feel. Very light weight. Good cushion. Found some time ago that Puma runs a 1/2 small. Maybe it is just my dogs but I always order 1/2 size larger. Would highly recommend

Value is outstanding. I'm glad I didn't spend $150 on shoes. These are the finest shoes I've purchased for golf. I don't wear socks with these shoes because I like the cushion feel. Perfect grip on the t and fairway.

For the money, this shoe is worth every dime.  They are extremely comfortable and feel great after walking 18 holes.  The only drawback is they are not waterproof.  Other than that, I would purchase them again.

It's hard to find golf shoes in wide widths...particularly when your foot is both short and wide, like mine is. I tried the Fusion Evos in a few sizes, but the bigger issue is that the soles felt...weird. I can't quite explain it, but they just didn't feel like they'd be comfortable and supportive for 18 holes.I also didn't find them to be the most aesthetically pleasing shoes. I liked them more in the photos than in hand.

I only had the shoe for a few days. So far, so good. It is comfortable to wear and good for exercise/walking. The one thing I don't like - since it is a slip-on shoe, you can't really tighten it around your foot. I prefer to have my shoes snug if possible. This is my first purchase of a slip-on athletic shoe. I find it a bit difficult to 'Slip' on. The heel always wants to mash down as you try and get the shoe on. Not a big deal overall.  I need more time in the shoe before I can really comment on the long term.

With recent knee surgery, these shoes were easy to get on and off. The value of the shoes is great. Very comfortable too, especially during physical therapy (PT).

Very comfortable shoes, but I've always worn a 10.5 and sometimes if there's a ""wide"" option, I'll get that too.

These shoes are the new slipper type.  When did athletic shoes change to this type where the tongue is attached to the shoe?  My husband is unable to get this type of shoe on and these were no different.  He did get one of the shoes on after a lot of work and said it was comfortable and a good fit.  We ended up returning the shoes.  I guess these would be good shoes if you are able to wear the slipper type of athletic shoe.  The shoes were the incredibly bright red in the photo which we were wanting and expecting.

These fit different color to color. I have three pairs. The black and white fit great. The red and black have TWO heel inserts to fit. The black red and white have one heel insert. Frustrating.

I bought these shoes and got them exactly 1 week ago. The soles are not holding up well.The soles of these shoes are made of two different types of rubber. The black sole material seems like it is holding up, but the red is wearing out ridiculously fast.I only have used these shoes to go to and from my car to work 3 days, about 100 yards total. The rest is on my desk treadmill going 3mph. I noticed that there was some weird dust at the end of my treadmill (see first image) the other day. Today I decided to try to figure out what it was. I looked at the belt adjustments and then as I got close I noticed that the dust was pretty red. I touched it and could tell it was foam rubber, then looked at the bottom of my shoes and realized they were getting shredded. I can't imagine how poorly they would perform on a sidewalk or asphalt track. I walk about 3 miles a day (1 hour at 3mph) and this is the most expensive pair of shoes I have purchased in the last 3 years. Not that they are high priced shoes generally, but they just don't hold up. Will be returning them.

Ok I tried this shoe just to see what they were like.  At first I liked them.  Here’s the rub.  The back of the shoe folds over easy and then becomes frustrating to get it right.  Also since there are no laces, the shoe is more like a slipper than a sneaker.  I need to get another pair of shoes because I don’t have the foot support and my feet hurt.  I got what I paid for.

There is TOO much curve in these shoes from heel to toe resulting in your big toe being smashed into your other toes.  It feels like the shoes are too small but they are not.

They fit really well and my son likes the color. He has very wide flat feet and we’re very comfortable. Just after the return window closed the inserts started falling apart.

I think these were just poorly made or with subpar material.

My husband LOVES these shoes. He said they are great for everything except squatting, hack squats, and anything that pushes down on the feet. That is because they have incredibly soft inserts or the bottom of the shoe, whatever you call it.

I only had the shoe for a few days. So far, so good. It is comfortable to wear and good for exercise/walking. The one thing I don't like - since it is a slip-on shoe, you can't really tighten it around your foot. I prefer to have my shoes snug if possible. This is my first purchase of a slip-on athletic shoe. I find it a bit difficult to 'Slip' on. The heel always wants to mash down as you try and get the shoe on. Not a big deal overall.  I need more time in the shoe before I can really comment on the long term.

With recent knee surgery, these shoes were easy to get on and off. The value of the shoes is great. Very comfortable too, especially during physical therapy (PT). The only issue is the loop at the heel is ripping off due to using the loop to adjust the shoes when putting on. Great color and get compliments on the shoes when wearing them to PT and out.

Very comfortable shoes, but I've always worn a 10.5 and sometimes if there's a ""wide"" option, I'll get that too. Well Amazon said something like ""based on your reviews"" and yadda yadda yadda, they said an 11.5 would be best, so that's what I got. Know what else I got...?Terrible advice and 2 shoes that were a whole size larger than what I would ever wear. Again, great shoes and super comfy, but from my experience that I just said is my opinion/advice. Good luck and happy shopping everyone!

These shoes are the new slipper type.  When did athletic shoes change to this type where the tongue is attached to the shoe?  My husband is unable to get this type of shoe on and these were no different.  He did get one of the shoes on after a lot of work and said it was comfortable and a good fit.  We ended up returning the shoes.  I guess these would be good shoes if you are able to wear the slipper type of athletic shoe.  The shoes were the incredibly bright red in the photo which we were wanting and expecting.
"

These fit different color to color. I have three pairs. The black and white fit great. The red and black have TWO heel inserts to fit. The black red and white have one heel insert. Frustrating. I STRONGLY recommend you spray these w stain guard. Order it now. One drop of water stained my first pair of red ones.

I bought these shoes and got them exactly 1 week ago. The soles are not holding up well.The soles of these shoes are made of two different types of rubber. The black sole material seems like it is holding up, but the red is wearing out ridiculously fast.I only have used these shoes to go to and from my car to work 3 days, about 100 yards total. The rest is on my desk treadmill going 3mph. I noticed that there was some weird dust at the end of my treadmill (see first image) the other day. Today I decided to try to figure out what it was. I looked at the belt adjustments and then as I got close I noticed that the dust was pretty red. I touched it and could tell it was foam rubber, then looked at the bottom of my shoes and realized they were getting shredded. I can't imagine how poorly they would perform on a sidewalk or asphalt track. I walk about 3 miles a day (1 hour at 3mph) and this is the most expensive pair of shoes I have purchased in the last 3 years. Not that they are high priced shoes generally, but they just don't hold up. Will be returning them.

My husband is 5’9 and where’s a size 12 in pumas and he is obsessed with them. Fit is perfect.
"
23168,"
Ok I tried this shoe just to see what they were like.  At first I liked them.  Here’s the rub.  The back of the shoe folds over easy and then becomes frustrating to get it right.  Also since there are no laces, the shoe is more like a slipper than a sneaker.  I need to get another pair of shoes because I don’t have the foot support and my feet hurt.  I got what I paid for.

There is TOO much curve in these shoes from heel to toe resulting in your big toe being smashed into your other toes.  It feels like the shoes are too small but they are not.  There is just too much of a curve in sole of the shoe which crushes your toes together.Not wearable for me as using as a walking shoe with repeated steps would result in blisters.

They fit really well and my son likes the color. He has very wide flat feet and we’re very comfortable. Just after the return window closed the inserts started falling apart. They have since completely disintegrated and are now terribly uncomfortable. We’re going to try store bought inserts but I’ve now noticed that the material on the tops of the shoes are wearing thin. I think these were just poorly made or with subpar material.

I am very impressed by the Puma Rs 2.0 Go sneakers. The multi-color and texture design is fresh. My biggest compliment is the comfort factor. I have wide size 13 feet and these fit perfectly; I adjusted the laces because they came typically shoe factory tight. They have a highly cushioned sole that provides support and a great step in. The current price of $39.95 is a bargain for Puma. Definitely recommend for an everyday shoe.

Got the order, tried them on and when I tightened the laces the fabric eyelet ripped out. Sent them back, got a replacement pair and same thing happened…same eyelet ripped out.  Too much of a coincidence. Must be a flaw in the sewing process.  This time I took a refund.

I had to send the first pair back becuz they didn't fit like a true10.5. I still wanted the boots so I ordered a size 11.

I normal wear size 14 in Puma shoes but I ordered these in 13 after seeing the other reviews.They do seem to have a little more bend in the toes than I am used to, but the shoe is very comfy, stylish, and the soles are very non - slip on the course. I did have to buy a new golf bag for my shoes because the heel on the back of the shoe is a tad high and my bag wouldn't sip close.I would say I was very leery about the soles of the shoes (this was my first pair or non - spike golf shoes), but they did a fine job all day out on the course.

I wish I could wear these; they look great and the cushion seems like it would have been good too.  But, even though I got ""wides"", they're not near wide enough.

This is the first shoe I've ever purchased where I had to go one size down from my normal Size 13 to a Size 12. Many reviewers and even Puma themselves say to do that, and they're correct. It's a mystery why they don't just make them the correct size.The shoes themselves are excellent overall. They definitely give you the sharp-dressed-man look on the course, even if they do look a little too ""golfy"" while traveling to/from the course. The standing and walking comfort are top-notch.For me, the toe is a little too flexible compared with my previous Pumas. I like to get up on that right toe during the follow-through, and these bend a little.It didn't take me long to test the waterproof-ness when I stepped in a puddle up to the laces. Success!Overall, I'm quite pleased. Now if I can just stop slicing drives...

I saw in advance that it runs large, so I downsized by half a size. Could potentially have done a full size, but I'm just going to roll with it. I will also note that the heel feels weird - its not snug, because the design has it pointing out. I haven't tested them on the course yet, but I assume because it's designed that way, it won't hinder stability or grip in any way!

Hatte mir den Schuh kurzfristig bestellt, bevor ich für 1 Woche in den Golfurlaub nach Portugal geflogen bin. Eigentlich war es mehr eine Trainings Reise… :-)Innerhalb von 7 Tagen waren wir an 6 Tagen je 18 Löcher spielen + ca 3 Std Training.Das heißt, ich stand jeweils ca 8-9 std ununterbrochneren in den Schuhen…Ich hatte erst Angst, dass ich mir Blasen laufe, da die Schuhe nicht eingelaufen waren.-> Resultat: die Schuhe sehen nicht nur spitze aus, sondern man läuft auch super bequem damit.Kein Drücken, keine Blasen!Was auch toll ist - die Schuhe lassen sich sehr einfach und gut abwischen… sehen noch immer aus wie neu!Klare Empfehlungen von mir! 👍😄

They definitely give you the sharp-dressed-man look on the course, even if they do look a little too ""golfy"" while traveling to/from the course. The standing and walking comfort are top-notch.For me, the toe is a little too flexible compared with my previous Pumas. I like to get up on that right toe during the follow-through, and these bend a little.It didn't take me long to test the waterproof-ness when I stepped in a puddle up to the laces. Success!Overall, I'm quite pleased. Now if I can just stop slicing drives...

These are great shoes - comfortable, good-looking, waterproof - really nice.Be aware that they absolutely run 1/2 size larger than shown, so order 1/2 size below whatever you normally wear.  I had to exchange a pair due to this issue.

I am so happy I took the risk to buy this shoe for my boyfriend. He wears size 13, and that's always a gamble when buying online. True to size, and they look real classy. Very sleek fit and he says they are comfortable. Waterproof is a must for golfing in AK, and they do not disappoint.

I saw in advance that it runs large, so I downsized by half a size. Could potentially have done a full size, but I'm just going to roll with it. I will also note that the heel feels weird - its not snug, because the design has it pointing out. I haven't tested them on the course yet, but I assume because it's designed that way, it won't hinder stability or grip in any way!

Like every other review says, order a smaller size because these run large!  I ordered a full size smaller and it fits perfectly.These shoes are waterproof with no visible holes for ventilation.  When I wore them in my house my feet started to sweat so I was worried how breathable they would be on the course.  I'm happy to say that I played on a 95 degree day and ventilation was fine.  My feet did not feel any hotter than my other golf shoes.Great shoes and I love the style.  Got lots of compliments.

Hatte mir den Schuh kurzfristig bestellt, bevor ich für 1 Woche in den Golfurlaub nach Portugal geflogen bin. Eigentlich war es mehr eine Trainings Reise… :-)Innerhalb von 7 Tagen waren wir an 6 Tagen je 18 Löcher spielen + ca 3 Std Training.Das heißt, ich stand jeweils ca 8-9 std ununterbrochneren in den Schuhen…Ich hatte erst Angst, dass ich mir Blasen laufe, da die Schuhe nicht eingelaufen waren.-> Resultat: die Schuhe sehen nicht nur spitze aus, sondern man läuft auch super bequem damit.Kein Drücken, keine Blasen!Was auch toll ist - die Schuhe lassen sich sehr einfach und gut abwischen… sehen noch immer aus wie neu!Klare Empfehlungen von mir! 👍😄

I ordered these in what I thought was Men's sizing, but when they came, it was WOMEN'S Sizing.  This is listed as Puma Men's Future Rider Sneaker.  IT IS NOT!  It's Puma WOMEN'S Future Rider Sneaker!  If you know your size in either men's or women's , like the style, buyer be ware!  Size to women's.  I ordered twice because I thought it was a mistake.

These would've been great except I received a women's 6.5 instead of a men's 6.5. Hence the 3 stars.I do love the colors and the design. (Navy blue, blue, light yellow with a little hot pink)However, I am not a fan of the foam edge on the tongue. It makes it look like a mistake was made when the shoes were sewn.I have to return because of the sizing issue. Otherwise if they had fit I would most likely keep them. Nice looking shoes.

Honestly wasn't expecting a lot.  I didn't think Puma was well known for trail running sneakers.  I have a lot of other brands of trail runners so I have something to compare these to.  First off, they were extremely comfortable from day one.  Most trail runners start off pretty rigid in my opinion.  Some reviews said they were heavy but I found them lighter than most.  Second, they run well on both road and trail. Finally, they've kept my feet dry through both rain and heavy dew.  Overall I have been very pleased.
"

The style is awesome. The colors are nice. I would have given them 5 stars if the shoe wasn’t so heavy. Sneakers should be lightweight. These are the heaviest sneaker I have ever purchased. Would have sent back but my son loves the style.

Very nice, fit well, very comfortable  also get a lot of compliments on how nice the shoe looks
"

They were very good for support and traction, but they were very uncomfortable to break in and gave me blisters during my first tournaments. Also after only about 6 months of heavy use walking 18 holes about 3 times a week, the heel fabric has started to wear away causing even more blisters. Also the toe area is not as comfortable as expected. I think most of this is due to how rigid the shoe is, so if you don’t have a perfectly fitting dry foot, there could be possible discomfort after extended use. I will say they look good, but I would recommend something more comfortable if you’re going to walk all the time. They also get very hot in the summer. Furthermore, the first pair I received had been used due to obvious dirt everywhere and large creases and they were too large. So I had to send them back and size down to a 9 for my usual 10.5. The next pair was new so that was good.

They were very good for support and traction, but they were very uncomfortable to break in and gave me blisters during my first tournaments. Also after only about 6 months of heavy use walking 18 holes about 3 times a week, the heel fabric has started to wear away causing even more blisters. Also the toe area is not as comfortable as expected.

Everyone is correct, order a 1/2 size smaller.  Aside from the sizing confusion, they're just generally hard to use.  They look OUTSTANDING.  But function is superior in athletic shoes, and balancing your weight on a very thin sole feels like you're wearing ice skates rather than golf shoes.  I can't imagine walking a round of 18 in these, they were uncomfortable just walking around the house.  They should also come with a user's manual for putting them on, the only way my fat behind was able to comfortably get them on my porker feet was to wedge my toes in, then step into them while standing.  Love the looks, appreciate the ingenuity, but the end result is a very heavy ""meh"" for $150.

Surprisingly I like the shoes more than I thought I would. Why, well because Puma has a reputation of making sub par quality shoes for decades now.

I was looking for a decent shoe that did not require laces and selected this one largely based on price but I was wrong. The shoe is not comfortable although it is padded the issue is you cannot stand in these shoes for extended periods of time without your feet starting to hurt. I'm going to stick with a running shoe as they have a slightly raised heel which is a good shoe if you need something comfortable to stand in for long periods of time. I'm going to be honest I've never had good luck with puma I'm going back to Nike.

Most slip on shoes have a weak heel support. These are easy to get on and the heel doesn’t collapse
"

Best running shoe in slip on category. Found it better than addidas. Looks nicer too. Memory Foam insert feels very nice. Good for brief runs only and doesn’t have much of a support built in that’s why 4 stars.
"

Great durable shoes! I walk five+ miles a day at my job and the tread of my shoes are still perfect. They’re comfortable to walk in and also work out in! They’re pretty breathable too. I’m too lazy for shoe laces, so these are great.

These are not made for northern maine in the winter. They are very comfortable but if you wear them outside your feet will freeze because they are paper thin.
"

If you have wide feet you should be careful buying this shoe. They fit tight and my feet fall asleep sometimes. It’s getting a little better as I break them in, but they are still a skinny shoe.

I hope Amazon brings this back in stock for the sale price - it is a great sneaker, love that there are no laces.Also has a small tag at the end so you can pull it to get your feet it without needing a shoe horn (no  need to force your feet in!). Very well designed sneaker. Can wear it with or without socks.Also seems to be better built compared to Skechers etc - nicely cushioned and better quality overall.Used it for international travel and it stood up real well.Planning to buy another one to wear inside the house once it is back in stock at the sale price.

I was looking for a decent shoe that did not require laces and selected this one largely based on price but I was wrong. The shoe is not comfortable although it is padded the issue is you cannot stand in these shoes for extended periods of time without your feet starting to hurt. I'm going to stick with a running shoe as they have a slightly raised heel which is a good shoe if you need something comfortable to stand in for long periods of time. I'm going to be honest I've never had good luck with puma I'm going back to Nike.

Rear tab on shoe broke the 2nd time I put them on - poor materials - workmanship looks good - but poor materials trumps the rest.

The tip of the shoe is already coming apart just after a few uses

Size was WAY smaller than expected, even in a wide width. So returned and went with something else.

One of the loops on the back (meant to assist slipping on the shoe) broke the very first time I tried to put them on.  Low quality materials.

Seems like a nice shoe but runs quite small. I normally run an 11.5 or 12 depending on the shoe and so I ordered an 11.5 and it was very very tight, I had to double check to make sure the shoes didn't get swapped as it felt more like a 10.5. Otherwise I liked the shoe and will try to find it in a larger size.

Otro nivel de tenis, Justo lo que yo esperaba: suaves, cómodos, me olvidé de los cordones!!!El único detalle es que en el primer uso del tenis, el cejillo que sirve para ponerlos por atrás se rompió al jalarlo (se supone que esa es su función: jalarlo para que entre el tenis no?), lo que tuve que hacer es quitárselos a ambos tenis con unas tijerasAl final me gustaron más como se ven asi.

I bought a Puma just like this about 5 years ago and it was the most comfortable shoe of this type, I have worn.  It finally started to wear out, so I bought this one, which is identical to the last one I bought.  This is just exactly as comfortable and exactly the same as the last one.  I LOVE THIS SHOE!!

I have been wearing Adidas Gazelle and Campus models for taijiquan (tai chi chuan) practice for many years.  I particularly like the Gazelle model because the soles are a soft, flat rubber with minimal tread pattern that allows you to do the heel and toe spins in taiji without binding to the ground too much.  One issue with the Gazelles is they are rather narrow and I sometimes feel some instability in balance or like I am almost falling off the edge of the sole.  The Campus model is slightly wider but the tread pattern is stickier, plus availability and price  seems to be an issue nowadays.  I decided to try this Puma version of the suede sneaker.  The good news: the sole is a soft rubber pretty similar to that on Gazelles.  I went with size 10s because the red ones happened to be heavily discounted; I wear 9.5 in Adidas but my feet are beginning to edge into the 10 zone so...  As it happens the Puma Suede Classic size 10 fits me very well and even turns out to have a bit more room in the toe box (possibly because of the larger size) than my Adidas shoes. The bad news: the Puma sole feels nice and thick under the heel but is surprisingly thin under the balls of the feet!  These will work well for taijiquan (for a while?) but otherwise I will use them more like Converse Chuck Taylors or One Stars: for driving and errands that don't require much walking or standing.  The extra set of white laces had been stolen - left in the box were the two empty little plastic bags.  Amazon should crack down on this pilfering!

I hate buying a pair of sneakers online that seem like such a great bargain, then they come in the mail and seem stiff, without any comfortable padding, and they just seem like terrible knock offs. I mean, the inside bottom sole isn't cushioned at all, and the sides walls of the sneaker aren't soft or cushioned at all either. Then it hits you, this is why these sneakers were cheap. BUT...these Pumas are not those cheaply made ones. The look great, they are truly classic Puma suede, and feel awesome on my feet. They are soft and padded nicely on the inside around the ankle and on the sole. As I stated in the headline, for $29.99, I should have bought multiple pairs! I love the grey/white look. I was watching these last year, and they dropped from $60 to $39. I wanted to purchase them last year, but didn't, and I was heart broken to see later that the price jumped back up to $60. My wife and I were sitting on the couch before this past Christmas, and she pointed out to me, ""aren't these the sneakers you were looking at awhile ago?"" She pointed out the incredible $29.99 price drop, and I ""clicked to buy"" immediately! If they offer them in other colors, still at that price, I might just get more!  In case you are wondering, I highly recommend these to any Puma lover, or anyone who loves great sneakers.  **Please note, I marked that these fit as expected. They fit as expected for a Puma sneaker. I have wide D sized foot. Pumas run a wee bit on the narrow side. These still fit great though**

I bought the blue and the gold and love them. As usual, they fit about 1/2 size large. I ordered the black ones after being rather surprised to see that they were back in stock following a long period of deadstock. The shoes I received were the ""Natural Calm"" style that can be found elsewhere on the site. They're not solid black though, they have a grey stripe and a cream colored outsole. The ""Natural Calm"" shoes list for $65, so if they haven't fixed the glitch yet and you're interested in buying them, just buy these tonal black ones and you can get a deal.Update: After I returned the wrong pair I received, it appeared that they fixed the problem because the black colorway suddenly had almost no sizes available. Then, about a month later, I looked and saw that a size 13 was in stock on Amazon marketplace. Occasionally a deadstock shoe will become available in one or more sizes when an outside seller lists whatever is leftover from their store. So naturally I thought that's what happened and was sure that I would get the real thing this time. Wrong. I received the same shoes as before-the ""Natural Calm"" edition which I included a photo of the last time. Very frustrating. And what's really frustrating is that they actually still make this shoe because if you look on the European website for Puma.com, it's one of the main colorways they sell (along with red/white, blue/white, and black/white). However they won't ship to the US. I just wish Amazon would order some more from the manufacturer. And yes I know there is a similar shoe sold here called Puma Suede LFS, but I already own a pair.In short, DO NOT buy the black ones unless you want the shoe in the picture I have provided.

Classic Puma shoes. very nostalgic. the look. the cut. the colors. all 5-star. like steppin into the 80's..( reason for 4 stars below )Fit :1) these are very Tight fitting. or i should say very Exact fitting (they arent tight in all the wrong places like Cheap sneakers are...they are very well designed, so they are tight all over. and hlthe Toe room is non existant if you purchase.your normal size(s)...i take a 9&1/2(usa) and normal width, in mens for 80% of sneakers.. the other 20% I take a size 10....i purchased the size 10 of these...and...they Just fit..and by just i mean they are on the very of being to short.and to tight.  i would definitly bug a 10&1/2 (usa) size next time (and if offered a slightly wider width)...BUT..i will be buying more..2) Comfort...this is an area that im a little confused on.. like most things that are.considered classic or retro. normally when they are Updated for today..they see improvemnt in key areas.. and the one thing about Puma's from the 80's till today...is that they arount very cushioned . you put them on and they dont feel like they are meant to soft on the inside.. and its kinda sad..with just some better insoles they would be an all around perfect sneaker (if you buy the Corrrect size)All in all i gobe the product 95 out of 100..  the Size i can buy larger...but they should atleast offer a Option for a more comfortable insole... (yeah i can buy a seperate insole from another company like Dr Shoals..but i shouldnt have to)

Back in the early 80's i was a pure bonafide B-Boy, cazal glasses, kangol bucket hat, dark non washed rough lee denim jeans, lee denim jacket, bvd shirts, lacoste and vintage le tigre shirts, leather bombers, grey, burgundy and beige sheepskin jackets, members only jacket,belt buckle with my name on it, huge boombox lasonic radio, tons of breakdancing, adidas superstars, nike navy cortez original, and last but not least my all time #1 favorite the suede pumas preferably burgundy with superfat laces and a sock rolled up into a square and placed under the tongue of all the sneakers to make them look tough, anyone looking to buy these sneakers you cant go wrong, this review is for the cabernet color which is really burgundy so dont get confused, i own 5 colors right now and will probably buy 5 more for the collection, the comfort is unbealivable, the colors on the suede are extremely well done and on point, i suggest buy half size smaller on the adult versions and half size bigger on the kids, my kids have 6 pairs between them and they love them just as my wife has a few also, i am a sneaker collecter and i started buying these again in early 2000's but were a little hard to find but i am glad they got them in production with tons of colors now, i just received the all beige and white last week and i only wore them once ( since i have about 100 pair of snakers☺) and i could not believe how many compliments i got on how beautiful that color was on the sneakers( chinchilla and white) also tons of compliments in the cabernet ""burgundy"", dont sleep on these timeless classics!!!!

What I liked about this product/shoe was the color as well as the appearance of the shoe. I purchased them to match my spouses shoe. She ordered a pair of high top Puma, white with a blue Puma emblem. We wore these shoes on our wedding day and that was very special to be able to wear comfortable shoes on your wedding day and not the ol' traditional dress shoe or converses.

I ordered these shoes and only read reviews afterwards. I cannot speak to the negative reviews previously posted, but can report that I am thoroughly pleased with my pair. I visited an official Puma store to inspect the genuine article before mine arrived. The green and white box is a variation that was mixed in plain sight in the store alongside the orange and white one. The pair of these shoes on display in store had the mesh tongue/padding; the pair brought out in my size at the Puma store had the leather tongue/lining. While the salesperson couldn’t explain the difference, it is obvious that both variants are in fact genuine Puma shoes. The pair I received from Amazon came in a green box (with the odd manufacturer’s label/sticker inside the box); they have the mesh tongue/liner, are perfectly crafted, all stitching clean, straight and symmetrical; the box was a bit banged around from shipping but the shoes were firmly and tightly wrapped in tissue paper, the toes filled with tissue and the tongues sheathed in plastic. The color is spot on and the fit is excellent, and they are very comfortable. I would absolutely order these shoes from Amazon again!

For myself the fit was correct and comfortable. However, I gave it 4 stars knowingly that the tongue tag of green Puma and white cat on black background is not as the 1970’s era original. Puma’s “jr” size shoes have the white cat and lettering on the tongue like I had back in the day. Still, I desired the nostalgic look and checks the box!Now if I could find an imitation  “Kangol”type hat with imitation beaver skin, my look would be complete.

I wore these Puma sneakers when I was a kid and loved them back then and still do. These sneakers are from a time awhile ago when things were much better. These shoes are comfy enough to wear for quite awhile, tho maybe a bit tighter than similar sneakers I wear from other brands, but not enough to cause any pain. I got size 11 and that's usually the sneaker size I wear and these fit me just fine, but again maybe a tiny bit narrower than other sneakers I wear or wore over the years, but still a 5 star sneaker to me. Suede top with decent rubber soles and these sneakers remind me of Air Walk sneakers I wore maybe 20 years ago....well the soles do at least. Great low-priced sneakers that I like wear most of the day with no problems and tho not exercise sneakers, you can at least take a good walk in them for awhile. I'd go 1/2 size up if you wear thicker socks tho as I said before, these sneakers seems a touch narrow. I ordered another pair of those blue/white Puma sneakers.

This is probably not the seller's fault, I had a puma classic that I bought a couple of years ago, the padding at the back of sneakers was of cloth material and filled with sponge. These new ones apperently do not have that, first day I wore them I felt like my feet were rubbing on concrete, it scracted my skin in a couple of places and even the socks had stains of blood from my feet on them, had them get them fitted with padding so I can wear them comfortably.Don't know what puma changed with the style or design and comfort level of these shoes but it definitely is not a comfortable who on its own without some heavy adjustments. Not like the super comfortable puma suede they made a couple of years ago

I've always liked these shoes.  They're colorful, comfortable, inexpensive and look good.  The only thing I don't like is that the tag on the inside of the tongue scratches your feet, unless you're wearing socks.  If PUMA would fix this, they would be perfect, but now the only solution is to cut out the tag.Update:  I ordered another pair and there doesn't seem to be any improvement with the tag.  They came with 2 pairs of laces, in different colors, but one pair is very wide, unfortunately.  I'm not a fan of super-wide laces, but they at least had the good sense to make the more narrow pair, the more difficult color to obtain.  The super-wide pair is white, which can easily be replaced anywhere you can find laces.I see many comments on the sizing being small, but I don't know that I agree.  They may be just slightly narrow, but I wear the same size as I do with Nike athletic shoes.  In contrast, I have to size up with New Balance shoes.  Since dress shoes run larger then athletic shoes, they're obviously smaller then most dress shoes.

If I'm being honest, the quality of the shoe itself is probably closer to a 4 star rating. However, the nostalgia factor boosts it up to a 5 star rating for me. I used to wear these shoes back in the 80s and I loved them! I decided to pick up a pair to see if they would fit and rock them as a throwback. The reason I wasn't sure if they would fit is that my typical shoe size definitely includes a 3E width and these only come in D(Medium). However, I'm happy to say that because of the way they are designed, once I loosened the laces, there was enough room for my foot to be comfortable in these. They are a bit snug when I put on athletic no-show socks. So for now I'm wearing them without socks but I'm going to look for a thinner style of sock going forward.They really do look nice and my wife and daughter gave me a thumbs up on them :-)All I need now are some parachute pants or two-tone jeans to go with them. LOL

I have wide feet (toes more so than heels), so I was worried these wouldn't fit. However, they fit great, and they're very comfortable. Not too narrow in the toe area, and I really like the padding around the heel. I was initially impressed by the built quality for these relatively inexpensive shoes, and as they broke in and became even more comfortable, they quickly became my favorite casual shoes.Unfortunately, the soft rubber soles have worn down very rapidly, much more wear than I've had with other sneakers, and in less than 5 months, the right sole has split open across the ball of the foot where the wear is most severe. The left sole is almost as badly worn in that area. I could have stepped on something, but it seems like it was bound to happen given the wear rate.In spite of this, I think I will buy a new pair and give them another shot. They're just so comfortable and they fit my sense of style -- and the price isn't so bad even if they don't last as long as I'd expected.

Update: the size 11 1/2"" fit a little better -they are still very narrow in the toe, however. They aren't uncomfortable like the 11's we're, and should loosen up a little the more I wear them.(Original review) These have been my go-to shoe for ages. HOWEVER, the last time I bought them (2 years ago), they had leather lining in the heel, and the tongue. And I bought size 11. I bought a new pair a week or so ago, and they are fabric lined, and the 11's were waaaaayy too tight. In fact the left shoe was tighter in the toe than the right. So I returned and am re-ordering 11.5, and hoping for the best.
"

These seem comfortable right out of the box and look good.  I had a hard time deciding what size to order based on the reviews, I try and avoid the order two sizes, return one situation if I can.  I have a few Puma athletic/cross training type sneakers which are size 10 and are fairly tight fitting but certainly not enough to consider going up a half size, so for me Puma's tend to run a little small.  Often I am a 9.5 in other shoes. Compared to the other Puma sneakers, these have a tad more room but there isn't enough that I would go down a size.  These sneakers have less padding and thinner material being more a lifestyle sneaker compared to an athletic sneaker.  I would say if you have experience with other shoes from Puma order the same size, if not then I think you will likely want to order a half size larger from your normal size for these.

They would have been unwearable if I had not used a pocket knife to gouge out a hardened bit of glue or something that was in the toe area of the show putting pressure on two toes. It was twice as large as a pea. The soles are full of hollow pockets that are just sized perfectly for gravel to dig into, once it does any small amount of water will seep through the bottom of the shoe. The soles under the balls of my feat ballooned out a bit. I really wanted to like these better.

Cool shoes. They are basic, versatile & have a timeless style. I really like the royal blue color. I'm glad Amazon sells shoes! Good price & free two day shipping. My only complaint would be the sizing; they are a bit narrow. I normally wear a 10-10.5, I got these in a 10.5 & they are a little tight. The length is fine but where the widest part of your foot goes, they are a little tight. Bear in mind, I just got these, so they should break-in & become more comfortable. I will keep these but if they were just a half size smaller I would return them & if I order another pair, I will get an 11. TO SUMMARIZE-- THESE ARE GREAT CASUAL WALKING SHOES, BUT THEY ARE A BIT NARROW, SO IF YOUR FEET ARE EVEN A LITTLE WIDE, I WOULD ORDER A FULL SIZE UP.

I got these for work.  In order to streamline my everyday life I decided to wear clothes only from one brand.  I thought this plan would free mine mind to concentrate on the important issues of the day.  I adapted this concept from Einstein who wore the same outfit everyday.  I selected puma for its breadth of clothing.  The brand could supply my workwear, casual wear, and with some adaptation and imagination everything else in between.  I've since abandoned this single brand philosophy as my wife found it very restrictive and I cause her enough problems as it is.  She was annoyed that I was wearing compression wear for bed, she didn't like me wearing a puma webbing belt with a pre-existing suit.  She didn't like my exhaustive search for a puma-branded tie.I have now returned to a wardrobe of mixed brands, a happier wife, and I still maintain these shoes.

I had to add an insolvent du to shoe edge kinda digs into your arch. with the additional and some break in they are the best value in my retro 80's shoe comparison. I compared to original reproductions from the era by REEBOK, PUMA, Adidas and Asics. Nike never fit me right on any era. If you're looking for old school simple flat shoes try Addidas Men's Advantage Running Shoe, Adidas Originals Men's Seeley Running Shoe, and PUMA Men's Suede Classic + Sneaker for similar styles.  the Adidas Mens Advantage gets a bit warm on the foot over time so if you live somewhere hot skip those.

These are ""interesting"" the reason I say ""interesting"" is they look good - cept the Puma strip is a odd tan colour - not white which I was expecting - been wearing them a couple of days & their all day comfy - not the most comfy I've ever worn - but not bad. The colour Red is brilliant - they also come with two set's of laces - a heavy Red set & a lighter White set - I went with the white set - pretty sharp shoes - driving wise ( I drive a Mini Cooper with a manual transmission) there fine - I have a after market peddle kit installed & these grab the peddles nicely - no issue with slippage etc - def worth the $29 which they were posted for on Amazon.

I work as a sign waver/street dancer approximately 5 hrs a day, 5 days a week, so I've torn through one pair and am on my second.These wear down nicely- the soles are solid rubber in the front and can get pretty thin before they break. The rubber doesn't peel away at the sides when you squat like converse-types do, and well worth the price over $10 payless shoes. They feel tight for the first few days, but settle nicely.No rivets to dig into your feet also means harder to tighten the laces.I bought a pair of the the cheapest similar shoes at payless for $10ish when these started getting worn out- the sole wore down to a hollow section with rubber bracing at both ends in a week (keep in mind this is excessive use- lots of dragging on rough sidewalks)Photos of the payless ones, and the pumas after excessive wear

These are amazing looking shoes, I love how they look and how the shoes themselves feel. I primarily wear them on weekends and around town. My issue is that they run a tad smaller than other brands. While this isn't a deal-breaker, I think that prevents them from being my daily wear. I'll save them for weekends and casual wear when I want to wear good looking shoes, but am not going to be walking long distances or needing to wear them for hours. Maybe consider ordering a half size larger than normal for this, but I'm happy with my purchase!

These are very solid shoes that provide style for a cheap price. With this cheap price however comes a slight hiccup in the product. For me it was the annoying narrow width around the toes and awkward padding which went away after two weeks. My experience the past 2 months with these shoes have been great besides the two weeks having the shoe mold around my feet. One big drawback about these sneakers for me though is the difference in material. The tongues of the two shoes seem look a little different but its not a deal-breaker.**PROS:-Stylish-Long Lasting-Comfy**CONS:-Takes time to break in-Narrow at first-Order a size up if you're worried about he width.

Nice suede, good looking.  Bought some Adidas suede campus sneaks that aren't nearly as nice for a little more.  The suede on the Adidas is awful looking after two or three outings.  Two complaints about this shoe.  One seems to be slightly smaller in the toe area and for whatever reason it hurts in the arch area.  But, for what I paid, they are very nice shoes.  It's likely that I just need to adjust the laces a bit more on the one side.

These Pumas are such great shoes, and I really love the way they fit my extra wide feet.  They stretch to accommodate but I don't feel as though I'm distorting the shoe, and my feet don't feel cramped inside.  This is a great option for anyone who loves a high quality shoe that won't break the bank - and the selection of colors is great, with new styles being released often.  I already have about 6 pairs of these in my shoe wardrobe and I'm sure I'll be adding more as I go along.  I also appreciate that they come with two pairs of laces to allow the look to be customized.  My one minor complaint is that the wide laces don't seem to stay tied very well, but it could have to do with how I am tying them.  Not a concern that would give me a second's pause to buy another pair!

Great shoe, comfortable. This pair is a repeat purchase to replace my prior pair. These shoes aren't as durable as you might expect of other shoes.

These shoes are what I expected. Not a counterfeit like I’ve read on some reviews. There was slight color fading, but it is stated in the box that it is possible.

These are a really great shade of blue and are really close to the color shown on the product page.I have a couple of these in different colors and I love the retro look just like back in high school(back in the day)when my parents couldn't afford to buy this style shoe for any of their children but we had shoes,and food in our bellies.Once I stumbled on the first pair of these I knew I had to have them just because I always loved this style with the suede and the colors.They fit well with the thinner sport socks and snug with thicker cotton/blend socks.And I don't recommend wearing these everyday as I've always heard if you can afford it buy"" really well made shoes""if you want to wear them  as an everyday shoe or have a few to several pairs of shoes to switch with that are of course comfortable and these are comfortable.I highly recommend this shoe!

Bought these for work at a university that shares similar colors and they are great.  as an everyday shoe you may want extra support from an add-in insert but they have been great so far.  Mine came with both a pair of both grey and orange laces allowing me to double lace the shoe.My one complaint was that one of the front stitching lines didn't match between both shoes on the front.  It was minor and probably just on this one right shoe but I noticed it.  No one else who isn't looking for it ever will so I just kept them.  Love suede pumas.

I have owned Puma Suedes before and two things I've always liked about them is that they run a bit wider than other sneakers and they fit true-to-size. Now, these shoes are brand new, so I am leaving some leeway here because I realize they will stretch out with time (but at this point they seem a little less wide than I remember and a little more stiff than I remember). The shoes are long enough so the ""somewhat small"" rating pertains to the slightly narrower width. As time goes on and they stretch out more, I'm sure they will get more comfortable, as with most shoes. I am mostly pleased with them, so thanks!

These are great looking shoes and I do like them, just can't wear them if I'm going to be spending the whole day walking somewhere. I wouldn't wear them to a city where I'll be on my feet all day or someplace like Disney. The right shoe tends to squash my smallest toe uncomfortably when walking more than a couple of hours. By the end of a long day of walking my feet are done. That has never happened to me with any other shoe. Weird. Other than that they seem to hold up a little better than other shoes I've had. Certainly last longer than the Vans I had (and paid much more for). Maybe when it's time for another pair I'll get one size bigger, it's just that size-wise they seem perfect, just one narrows much more at the toes. I have plenty of other shoes where that doesn't happen so these stay in the rotation for light footwork days.

Not a bad pair of shoes. The shoes are still wearable 1 year later. The 1 major issue I found was that the inner sole is slightly smaller then the entire shoe meaning if you wear these without socks; the edge of the sole will dig into your foot. With socks, it’s not a major issue.

I bought these primary for their appearance, but I must admit that I was hoping that they'd have more cushioning and better arch support than they do. I was hoping they'd feel more like a running shoe, than Converse All Stars or Vans (which I have and love wearing ... for short stints). I normally wear a size US 10D Mens and that's what I ordered and they fit very well ... however, I may try ordering a pair a 1/2 size larger and get some decent inserts to make them a bit more comfortable. Not sure inserts would actually fit in this pair.

Was in the mood to get some new sneakers and the Puma Suede's were a great choice. Look wise, they look a lot better when worn than the what the pictures show; appearance of the shoes gets a two thumbs up from me. In terms of comfort, I can wear these all day without any discomfort and it feels nice to walk around thanks to the shoe's foundation. I did get them a half a size bigger than my actual shoe size but it still fits quite comfortably when tighten. The shoes take quite a bit of damage, without ruining the look of the shoe. No mud gets stuck to the bottom of it either, which I definitely liked. Recommended to anyone looking for a nice pair of sneakers anytime soon.

I have worn a size 10 D (M) for many years, which is what I ordered when I bought these shoes. The first time I wore them, I did three miles at a brisk pace on the treadmill, which I do regularly. The shoes felt like they were really squeezing my feet, width wise, and when I took them off, I had mild blisters on both heels and my feet were both swollen. I am trying to wear them for short periods to get them broken in, but they still seem too narrow. In retrospect, I should have gone up a size in width. Otherwise, I like the style and construction very much.

I basically just wear these as a walking around shoe.  I really like the color (collegiate burgundy and white).  I normally wear a 10.5 but got a size 11 and they fit great toe to heel but they are narrow.  They do seem to stretch out during the day so, while not ideal, they are comfortable to wear after a while, otherwise they feel just a tad to tight width wise.  I guess I have fat feet.  Overall though I like this sneaker.

I've been wearing the suede Clyde for decades - in the last 2 years the quality is not quite the same. uppers are not the same thickness nor are the soles the same flexibility - even the laces are cheaper. It's too bad these kicks are street classics..

Wanted a pair of PUMA in size 11 wide but they were no where to be found.  Was hoping these PUMAs in a size 11 1/2 would work.  But still a bit tight.  These are good looking walking shoes but very narrow.

Awesome looking sneaker. Order a size big. I always order size 9. These definitely run about a size small. Kind of narrow as well, and I have a "" normal"" width. Holding up very well, though.

My boyfriend was a big Nipsey Hussle fan and he's been eyeing these for a while.  He has wider feet so I sized up because they seemed narrow.  The toe area was still slightly tight but he will break them in.  Otherwise he is in love with them.  They look great.  Make sure to get protectant for the suede so they don't get water damage.  And if you have wide feet, try a half size up.

From a fashion perspective, they look good and serve as a nice alternate to casual Friday/jeans day.I normally wear a 12 wide and sized up to a 12.5 like others have suggested. I should have bought the 12 instead. It's not like going a half size longer bought me more width. The suede hugs my feet and makes my feet look like plump sausages about to bust through the casing. And now I've got too much extra room in the toe box.I have worn these shoes at work on a casual Friday and to the airport when traveling. I find that after about 4 hours of some light walking, I feel like another 4 hours of light walking/activity and I may be in for some blisters. They are not very comfortable for long durations and I don't know if that's a function of the flat soles, the longer shoe length or the tight width or a combination of all three.
"
24490,"
Based on my past knowledge of Puma (and a rival brand too), I based my choice of size on the assumption that I should go a half size higher than normal. Consequently these were a perfect fit. However, I would advise anyone who is not sure of their own ideal fit that these sneakers are not a particularly wide fit and when ordering online, you will find out there is no option for alternate widths. I take a D width and they feel very good on width. if they stretch out after a few wearings I'll up-date.

Good looking sneaker for a remarkably low price. Fit is spot on and the shoes are comfortable from day one. I wear my PUMA suede classics for casual wear, for running errands around town, or for just lounging around. I have dress casual sneakers that cost up to ten times the price but don’t enjoy wearing them any more than the suede classics. Buy a pair or two. You will wear them often I assure you and enjoy every minute.

When I saw this shoe it took me back to my high school days.  The shoes have that classic retro look.  I ordered my true size of 10 and 1/2 which fit perfect.  Sometimes when ordering online, that can be a gamble.  They a very comfortable.  I will be wearing them as a casual shoe, not for athletics.

I’ve purchased several pairs of this style of pumas. I like the style a lot but they aren’t very comfortable. I usually have to buy an aftermarket insole. I do have very flat feet so that is also a factor. They do hold up well.

Cool shoot great price. Only complaint is photo has laces looking yellow and in reality they are closer to orange. Darkish yellow, light orange. Certainly not the pure yellow depicted int the photo. Not sure if this is an anomaly and my pair are only ones colored that way, or if the photo is misleading. Nevertheless, I still love the shoe! They also came with a pair of very wide pair of black laces which is a nice option to have. Overall very pleased.
"
24497,"
They look and feel so great I am a 9.5 shoe and these are spot on... the light blue color is perfect.  the only small gripe I do have is that the white stripe along the sides of the puma's classic sneaker is that somewhat of off-white in color to it, I wish it was more of a true bright white so that it would blend in better with the rubber sole of the sneaker!!  that's my 2 cents
"
24498,"
I got these because last year, I got two pair in this style in blue and black and I love them and needed a comfortable gray shoe to go with gray pants.  Unlike the two pair I owned first, these are suede.  They have gotten wet and walked through wet grass and puddles and still looke brand new(much like the first two pair I bought).  I've been a big fan of Puma's shoes for years(especially for their value) and this product pleases me.  I ordered large based on my first tow pairs and because it was my first time buying shoes online and that's probably why I said they were somewhat big.

These shoes are long and narrow, I have a ton of space around my toes but the side of the left shoe rubs the outside ball of my foot.  I like the look of them and they still look pretty good after a month or so of wear. Quality wise they're holding up pretty well. Puma wins big points for sending an extra pair of shoelaces. I had a puppy destroy the pair that came in the shoes so it was nice to have a backup. Four stars for timely delivery and a good bargain on the price.

I like this type of shoe for travel and casual wear.  It gives good support and comfortable for walking like in cities or airports.  It can be dressed up to a casual level with khakis.  Also blends in with crowd not flag waving like wearing a Rolex or Louis purse.  Good value

The shoes fit great. I normally almost always wear vans, but I figured I should give a new pair of shoes a shot, so I quickly bought a pair of these when I saw that they dropped down to $30.00. I normally wear a size 13 in all my vans/merrell/dress shoes, and so I got these in 13 as well, and they fit great. I got the black and white pair, and I like how they look. My shoes did not come with an extra pair of white laces, so I'm planning on ordering a pair of those.
"

These sneakers do not run true to size. I had to order a second pair for one full size over my usual size because the size I generally wear was too small and narrow. The width is narrow near the middle. They look great but not comfortable

The style itself is tight. The shoes arrived sooner than expected though, I’m pleased with that. The shoe fits alittle to tight around the toe area. I have a normal size foot for the most part. I’m 5’6, athletic build, 148Ib. Size 8 in men. Us size. I have a normal arch in my foot and slender feet. I wouldn’t recommend using to walk long periods in. Nothing like fairs, festivals, amusement parks etc.

I saw a bunch of reviews claiming they received counterfeits. I'm no expert but the pair I ordered seemed to be genuine. If they are knock offs they're convincing enough for.My main gripe is that they're a little tight. I even ordered a size up from my usual and my toes still feel crammed up against the tip of the shoe. The sole is pretty rigid so I don't know that I'll do a lot of walking around in them. Probably just wear them to the office on Fridays.They look great though!

today is 11/25/17 1:24pm have recieved tennis shoes and they look great and more importantly fit good. I had some apprehensions about buying shoes without trying them on first. I wear a size 10 and purchased a 10 and they fit true to size I could not find this tennis shoe at any of the brick and mortar stores from one side of town to the other I almost gave up.The cost was excellent in comparison to similar models by the same maker.

They look great and arrived really fast!Fit is just as expected, I wear 10.5 and have a wider foot - had no issues.

there are a lot of reviews thinking these are fakes because of the ""YCM""' sticker on the inside of the box and chinese writing, but they are not.

Definitely a great shoe. It looks just like it does in the picture and it looks great in real life. The only problem I have with it is that the sole on the left shoe was not fit in very well so I can feel a crease in it which bugs my foot. However other than that I think it is a great shoe, especially for the price.

UPDATE: Before I started buying Pumas  I had inherited an old pair of Pumas that belonged to my father who has since pasted away. I know he had owned them for a long time. They are a half size smaller than what I buy, but I can still wear them. The soles are much more durable than today’s Pumas and only the upper edges around the ankles are wearing out. The last three pairs that I’ve ordered the soles have worn out long before the upper or rest of the shoe. (see photo, hole ). The soles just aren’t what they use to be. Three strikes and you’re out, I’m going to try a different brand of shoes.  ......................................................................................................................................................................................................  I suffer from Plantar Fascia and have learned from a Doctor that the athletic shoes that I have been wearing are to stiff and over supportive for my needs(I do not run or jog) and that I need a shoe that gives more and allows the foot to flex some(after all your foot is designed to flex and move, not be as stiff as a board). I got a used pair of these from my father and liked them so much I ordered a new pair. They are now the casual shoe of my choice.

There are no surprises here.  Color, fit, size was all exactly what I expected to get.  The arch is a little weird in these, but they're suede...it's not like they're meant for basketball or running.  It's not weird enough to keep it from becoming my goto casual Friday shoe.  I wear a 10 in most shoe brands, and this was a PERFECT fit in terms of length and toe space.
"
24524,"
Shoe looks good as expected.  Has retro-style.  Problem is sole/support is also retro.  And since shoe fits as expected I can't add an aftermarket cushion sole - would then be to tight.  Lesson learned, but dissatisfaction has to do with me, not Amazon or manufacturer.
"
24525,"
I ordered two pairs, one my usual size and the other next size larger. Glad I did because the show in my usual size was slightly tighter and uncomfortable, but the larger size was a better fit. Btw Amazon wardrobe is awesome— if you haven’t tried it yet, give it a go. Let’s you order stuff **without charging your card** for 7 days and only pay for what you keep. Been buying lots of clothes that way now.

I LOVE THESE SHOES!!They are completely worth the price. I've had this pair for about 2 months and I've walked in the rain, through mud and slush and after washing them off, they were as good as new. Somehow they didn't even smell, even though I had to dry them in my room as I live in the dorm.I would recommend these shoes to anyone who wants a pair to wear throughout the day.(Although I will say that I'm not sure these shoes will last long if worn in the gym but to each his own)
"
24527,"
I found that the shoes are extremely comfortable. The color is nice and vibrant. Really enjoyed wearing them. I have only worn them once so I can't comment on the durability of the shoes. They seemed well made but the suede is pretty soft and I was concerned that it might break over time. I do recommend these shoes, though.
"
24528,"
I love the bright red color and the comfort of the shoes; however, the extra white laces provided are extremely wide which is not my cup of tea. Another point to take note of is that the suede is difficult to keep clean without using proper suede maintenance products. The outsole is nice and sturdy, but my pair were eventually worn down to the point where a hole emerged around the ball of my foot. Overall, I would recommend these be worn as casual sneakers for anyone who isn't planning on anything too athletic, and wants a bright colored, comfortable shoe.

I have heard from a few people that Puma runs small, so I decided to size up. I am usually a women's 7 and wear a women's 7/men's 5 in converse, so i decided to size up to 7.5 women. However, puma's women to men conversion is a bit different, with 7.5 women equal to 6 in men, not a 5.5 like converse would be. So the shoes turned out a tad big. i should have sized up a half size in respect to men's sizes (from 5 to 5.5) instead.other than that, the quality is nice and since i usually have wide feet, buying a men's shoe helped and the sides did not feel tight.
"

The shoes were a gift and fit well in his normal size. They are a good looking classic shoe, but the suede does get a bit fuzzy looking after a few wears. One of the colored laces got super shredded and fuzzy when it untied and he didn't immediately re-tie it, but that's not the fault of the shoes, because most people don't walk around with untied laces for an extended period of time lol! I guess the condition of the suede after a few wears could also be from rough use by the wearer also! Great shoe altogether.

These were nice-looking shoes, but they were about a size narrower than advertised.  I wear a 9D (US), and these seemed to be a 9C.  I wore my pair a handful of times.  After a few wears, they hurt my feet, and I had to donate them.

I have the real original puma Clydes and had to wear 1/2 size larger than normal. Puma stated that the current sizes are the same but they are larger than the Clydes, but not enough to make huge difference. The suede isn't as nice and the stripe should be white not a whiteish beige. The choice of laces is a nice option. The tread is the same as the original, so it is a royal pain to clean if you step in dog poop.

Order arrived on time and in good condition. I love these sneakers. However, just as other people have posted, they are quite a narrow sneaker and a little small. I usually wear a US 10 so this is what I ordered. However, they were just a teeny, tiny bit small. I tried them on and wore them around the house for a couple of hrs (so I could still return them if need be) and they were ever so slightly pinching my toes. Whatever size you typically wear get either 0.5 or 1 size bigger.

I bought these ina 10.5D and they feel a little narrow. It could be that at 46 years old my feet have gotten wider (not sure if that's a thing) but they do feel a little tight on the sides. Other than that fit is good and I love the way they look.

I purchased these shoes for my husband, he chose the color. They arrived within the specified time and were exactly as described.

This is probably the 3rd pair of these shoes I have bought over the years. They are slightly narrow! Keep that in mind if you have wide feet. I ideally wear a 13 4E, but size 14 works well (though still a tiny bit narrow). They look nice and they are comfortable. I do wish the white decals on the sides were as white as the soles, but perhaps that's an issue with leather vs rubber.Highly recommend! Thank you PUMA for supporting us bigfoots.

Bought these on sale on prime day. I have a pretty serious shoe collection, mostly dress shoes. I wanted to add some sneakers to my rotation and suade seemed like it would appeal to me more than most sneakers. I love the color. They are super comfortable. They look great. I have only worn them twice and I have had numerous people compliment me on them both times. They come with two pair of laces one green and one blue. Changing laces really changes the look of the shoes and is a nice touch.

When I was about 15 years old, these were the ""must have"" shoes (I'm 54 now). As soon as I saw these I jumped on them. Still comfortable and cool, just like in the 70s. One of my customers manages a chain athletic shoe store and says they are selling tons of these shoes. My GF saw them and asked me to order a pair for her.

I wear a mens size 13. my feet are a little on the wide side, and I have always found puma's to fit well. these shoes don't offer much arch support, so there not great for running, or wearing on long walks, but you cant beat the style and comfort for hanging around at a back yard BBQ with your boys.

Bought these specifically to go to away Mets games.  There seems to be a trend these days of having the laces be woven a certain way, and I didn't change them the first day.

was ready to order them in colors but fit is bad, too narrow at ball of foot and a little long. tongue and heel have vinyl(?) stitched to inside. seemed ok when i tried on for a minute but walking around block was different story. even gave away that size and order up another half size and laced loose, still same problem. Vinyl ridge of tongue and its stitching fight the ball of my foot for already snug space. have to wear sock tall enough to cover ankle as top edge of vinyl tongue also digs into ankle and creates red mark. can only wear a few hours. oh well, keep looking for retros that actually fit.

I just received these shoes, so this is a very superficial review at this point. They look great, fit well, are comfortable, and seem to be well constructed.

They fit perfectly with an additional insole & orthotics. So far I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend these shoes.

Aesthetically my favorite pair of shoes ever. These Puma Suede sneakers really are classics and have a timeless feel to them. However; I am having a problem with the tongue. It keeps sliding inwards. I've laced through the loop mid-way on the tongue as well as through the label tag. This helps but it still refuses to stay snug.Again these shoes look awesome and it would be a shame if you can't wear them for long periods without irritation.

I normally wear 12. I read all of the reviews in advance and they said that the Pumas run narrow. This allowed me to order a size larger to allow for a tiny bit more width. Great looking shoe, the little bit of extra length is a minor distraction as I don't intend to use a red suede low top sneaker for any actual physical exertion... just to look sporty. I have Asic Gel and New Balance for actual sports wear. :)

Puma is my signature sneaker and I can't get enough of them so I've owned quite a few pairs and the sizing is really hard to get right. They are often too small even if you go a half or full size bigger. Even the same sized shoe and style may be cut narrower or wider than the last pair. Possibly based on where they are manufactured. Still I love the style and the comfort, wish they were easier to find in all the cool colors.

I have been looking around for a sneaker of this style and color and finally found these.

I love these.  I've never worn Pumas before.  I'm >50 and  grew up a Converse kid and then converted to Nike.  These are just great casual shoes.

The burgundy color also bled on to my white laces, so I went back to the red so it wouldn't be noticeable.  I fought with myself about lower this to 3 starts but they are way too comfortable and the still look good.  I will probably buy another color soon because after all they are cheap enough to own more than one pair.

I hadn’t bought shoes in way too long and immediately fell in love with these. They’re comfortable, tidy and modest. The only critique I’d have is that the arc is a bit uncomfortable but I think that might have more to do with my pseudo flatfoot. Either way, I’m glad puma is back making great shoes for good prices.
"

I used to love these shoes but as time goes on they keep making them with cheaper materials.  The soles on these shoes have worm through with multiple holes after only a few months of, let's say, every-other-day wear.  They used to make the shoes with leather inners but now they are made with a cheap fabric.  It has resulted in holes near my ankles and now cause pain to my feet when i wear them.This will unfortunately be the last time i buy these shoes from Puma.  Shame on them for ruining a once great shoe.  I have a pair I bought years ago that has the higher quality materials and are still in my rotation of shoes I wear.  These shoes have unfortunately gone the way of may once-great brands.

I can usually fit into 10.5 or 11, but 11 in this style was just too large.  Having said that, they looked great!  I've returned for 10.5.  Ironically, I also ordered another pair of pumas (different style-canvas) in a 10.5.  Wore them today and they are a bit too snug.  Go figure.

Fine shoes, however, I always wear 10.5 and ordered a 10.5, only to discover that they were a slightly bit lengthy than expected. With socks on, it is not a problem. There is some space in between my toes and the front inner part of the shoes. It is still comfortable though. The shoes overall is worth it. I liked the black one which goes well on blue and black jeans.
"

This is my second pair of these shoes and I fully expect this to be the only kind of shoes (of this type) that I will ever buy again. I normally wear a size 10D,  so that is what I ordered the first time, but I had to return them for replacement with a 10.5D so at least in my case, they run a half size smaller than the shoes I normally wear. Other than making that adjustment, I love the shoes and highly recommend them.
"
24580,"
Based on reviews I decided to buy these shoes a size larger (10.5) than my normal size (10)but it turned out to be big for my feet.  I decided to live with it but you should try these in store Or if none are nearby I would go with your normal size.  They are still very comfortable and stylish With the black and white colors.  I also like the option of white or black laces.
"

I love the looks of these shoes.  They look much like the first pair of leather tennies I ever wore ... back in 1973-74.  Comfortable, nice looking and go well with the spirit wear for a local high school team I back.  The shoes are light weight and I don't consider them ""athletic"" shoes, just casual footwear.  When I walk long distances or stand on my feet a lot I either opt for sturdier shoes or put orthotic inserts in these.
"
24582,"
I almost always use insoles with my shoes, so I never actually wore them with the insoles they came with.  I use a SOLE Softec Response insole, and it makes this pair of PUMAs extremely comfortable.  They are a very durable pair of shoes that don't show a lot of wear.  The only problem that I'm starting to run into is wearing these shoes too much--almost to the point of wearing through the sole of the shoe (which is only a compliment to the product).

Great item.  I used my Amazon points to purchase (at no cost) for my husband who was not sure if he would like this brand.  He usually likes a band I no longer will purchase so tried these and they were a steal he loves them and they look great.  Worth the purchased price....See picture

These are decent looking shoes.  They run a little narrow.  The suede is nice to feel haha.  Overall I like them, I have pretty normal width feet and these are kinda narrow and the laces are like BARELY long enough to tie.
"

Fits well and looks good. However, suede fabric is fairly thin and needs to have a thicker/softer feel to it. Prices of different color options vary widely and needs to be more uniform. I would have purchased several pair but the other colors I was interested were 20+% higher priced than this one. Not good!
"

These are pretty great shoes. They fit really well, but look really large on my feet. Probably because of the large white bottom. I have pretty big feet so they're not perfect for me. They are really comfortable though and look good. I just wish my feet weren't like skis for skiing.

I went wit the orange and blue color combo and love them.

It makes no sense. I have a pair of pumas and I was planning on moving to a new city and while my old ones are in good shape after YEARS, I thought I should get a new, shiny pair. In fact, when they arrived, I didn't wear them. Then I got busy and ended up not trying them on for a few months. Then I realized I should break them in. I have been wearing them for a little over a month almost every day. I started getting blisters on the back of my feet. So I put on band-aids assuming they just needed a little time. Then I tried baby powder thinking the smooth back might be rubbing against the back of my feet. Then I started wearing two pairs of socks, one of which is longer to cover more skin. I now have a blood stain on the back, blisters that keep opening, and I can't return them. I just don't get it. I generally wear my sneakers every day and it's just so disappointing, not to mentoin painful. I know I can't return them but I just wanted you to know. Maybe they changed the back of them, but they are killing me. Now I have a new pair and I have to go back to my old shoes (which I have had over two years and are still fantastic.)

After reading reviews online about running narrow, I found them to fit true to size. I actually could have bought a size 11 (I am a size 11 1/2 narrow).  That is the problem with buying shoes online--you have to try them on.  It is still morning and feet tend to swell during the day, so I will keep them and maybe put another insole in to firm them up.

These are my favorite shoes.  I'm a shoe guy, I have about 30 pairs.  I just got my second pair of these in a different color and I don't think I will buy a different kind of tennis shoe, I'll just buy these in different colors.  They have about every color combo you could want.  They're warm enough to wear them in winter, and cool enough to wear them in summer.  They look good in pants and in shorts.  The perfect sneaker.

I pretty much knew that these shoes would fit well and I got them in the gray and another pair in blue at amazing prices so they were worth it. So far they've been very durable, they look great, and they are very comfortable without me having to adjust the laces much and I'm happy with these shoes.

I purchased the item on sale for $19 shipped.  Pumas always are a step smaller then US size shoes.  So order a half size bigger.  Since this product is suede I made sure to use leather protector on it before wearing.  Not a lot of arch support for people with those issues.

Great shoes and pretty much exactly what I expected, The yellow was a little darker (orangish than I thought from the online pics, but that's not a problem for me). I had a pair many years ago, so I already knew that the arch support wasn't terrific, but very stylish shoes and I really like them

I bought these because I couldn't find my favorite Speedcats anywhere (are they discontinued?) - I also bought some Ecco sneakers at the same time and have to admit when trying on one of each shoe they Ecco shoes are way more comfortable support-wise BUT for what these are (I mean, I'm not running a marathon here) they're perfect.  Love the colour (hard to find women's sneakers that don't have pink or purple on them) and how they look.  Size felt accurate.
"

First, Puma's come a half size smaller than what you would typically wear in the U.S. I learned this after purchasing two separate pairs of Puma shoes. So order them a half size bigger.Second, these are super nice looking shoes with a good selection of color. The support is not that great, but man do they look cool... and that is the most important thing. Glad I bought them.

Been wearing Puma for many years. Historically leaned more toward the California and GV Special shoes with a little beefier sole profile. The Classic+ sole is a little more uniform in terms of detailing and height variance. Comes with two lace options, which is always nice. I'm a little more drawn to the red laces in terms of color, but--interestingly--its a fat lace. And once I had the red threaded into place felt like it was a little too much. The blue is a more subdued, typical-sized option that still looks terrific with the shoe and makes the Puma stripe carry the flash.

I wanted to provide an answer for a question I myself had concerning fit. For those that often wear Nike you know that Nike runs small. If you wear an 11 in most shoes you will need a 12 in a pair of Nikes. For those considering purchasing these shoes know that Puma runs true to size. If you wear an 11 in most shoes, an 11 in Puma is going to fit perfectly as these shoes have for me.

I LIKE THESE SHOES.  I DON'T HOWEVER UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS A $20 DIFFERENCE ON THE SAME SHOE BETWEEN DIFFERENT COLORS.  $39 FOR A PAIR OF PUMAS IS AN OKAY DEAL.  $65 IS A RIP OFF.  SO I GOT THIS COLOR BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES I COULD AFFORD.

I am a size 11 1/2 - 12. I was concerned about getting an 11 1/2 size because its hit and miss. These shoes fit well. I was suprised and expected them to fit tight. They are perfect.

I was a poor kid in high school (1970s) and had to wear canvas Converse All-Stars - which were good but not as cool as the leather suede Puma Clydes that the truly cool kids wore. Now that I'm richer than all of those cool kids, I can wear whatever I want and I have found the Puma Suedes to be most comfortable and retro stylish. On the plus side, they match my Ford Mustang GT - something else I couldn't afford when I was a poor high school student in the 70s.

I like these shoes a lot, but what I didn't take into account was how noticeable dirt and water stains would be on such a light gray. It's not that big a deal though, I just bought some suede cleaner and proofer, and they are better now. I would recommend proofing them as soon as you get them and clean them reasonably soon after they get dirty, because the cleaning method with a brush sort of ruined the suede just a tad after the dirt and such had been left on for an extended period of a few days to a week.

The fit is perfect, colors are vibrant, and just an all around great shoe. These are my third pair and I'll buy another when I burn through these.

These look great and fit comfortably, but they shouldn't be confused with athletic shoes. They're comfortable enough for walking around and general wear, but don't offer much in the way of support.

Buy them for their classic, understated stylishness and just get a pair of running shoes for the track.

I didn't realize it when I first tried them on, but after a day or two my big toe felt a bit sore. Normally a 10.5 in Puma suede fits me perfectly. They're  running a bit smaller then usual. Other then that they'd be five stars.

Perhaps I'm simply buying the wrong type of shoe and I was never the intended foot for this shoe.1. This shoe is slippery. Any occasion that I've encountered a moderately smooth surface or any wetness at all has met with traction issues. I live in the Pacific Northwest and deal with a ton of rain - I didn't expect the shoe to have such dismal levels of grip. I've already fallen on my arse twice now wearing these. I couldn't tell you the last time I had that happen. Why wear a shoe if it isn't going to give you traction? Why would somebody design a shoe with such terrible grip?2. Even with arch supports put in this shoe is relatively uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend it for anybody who puts a lot of pressure on their feet. I've tried to wear them in and take a few longer walks in them and every time I'm met with misery. Wearing these shoes makes me not want to move.Long story short, I've clearly made a mistake in purchasing these shoes. I like how they look, but it ends there - even so, the plastic lower section isn't exactly the pinnacle of fashion.Why did I do this to myself? If you expect any work out of your shoes - I wouldn't buy these.

Despite purchasing these from Amazon directly (the ships from and sold by Amazon tag was clearly visible) I received a fake pair similar to another recent reviewer. They didn't feel right at all; almost felt like wearing a cheap 20 dollar pair of chuck taylors (felt like the only thing between your feet and the ground was a thin layer of canvas). After researching, sure enough these aren't genuine Puma's. I also compared what they SHOULD look like on Puma's site, and the fabric behind the tongue, and on the heel is totally wrong (should be a mesh fabric, and instead it's a vinyl type feeling material..) They were VERY stiff and uncomfortable. I'm really upset that even though I purchased from Amazon directly, I still received a counterfeit product. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning them and waiting for a credit. I don't believe i'll be purchasing shoes on amazon any longer based on this horrible experience! The previous reviewer was correct, there is a sticker on the inside of the box that says ""YCM PRODUCTS"", which is a chinese manufacturer...that's the dead give-away that these are fake fake fakeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My 10 yr old son LOVES these shoes!  They aren't as padded as the Hoke, but he says they're comfortable and he's much more pleased with the teal color.  Now, let's hope they hold up and we can get at least 4 months wear out of them!

I have never been a fan of these style of shoes, but have heard they are comfortable so gave them a shot.  I have to say, these are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.  You won't be dissapointed in your purchase if you decide with this item.Updated:  Won't change the rating because the shoe quality wasn't the problem.  I normally wear a size 12 in most shoes, but this one was a little tight and I know if I would have kept them, I would form blisters.  Had to return them.
"

Already have a dozen pairs and these are the real thing. Cannot believe I got these when they where priced at $23...grabbed them when I could as the price went up by $12 the day after. Was going to wear them for work but look to good to paint in.
"

The shoes look good, but they are a little tight, but that should be fine once they're broke in.  I don't care for the wide shoe laces, and the suede's dye has stained the shoe laces already (I've only had them for 3 days now).  Other than that, I think they'll be fine and comfy.  If these last a few months without problems, I may get another pair in another color.
"

These are a great every-day shoe. I got them for my ""casual"" days at work and got complements on the very first day wearing them. They look much bluer than the photo, so don't worry that they're going to look black. Super comfortable, look great, and feel durable. Just be careful to avoid getting the suede wet.

These aren't the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned but they look really great. I've had them for several months now and they are completely broken in but still in tact and I still wear them from time to time.

I've always thought that I had, if not narrow, at least rather average width feet, but with Puma's the fit is almost always just a little tight in the toe box. I love the shoes but will have to stretch them a bit for comfort.

These shoes look great. Only issue I have is that some of the stitching on the inside seems off and rubs against the foot.

The shoe fit perfect and it came with 2 laces (fat&skinny). Good qaulity suede, Packaged and ship by amazon directly. Came very well protectect and new. Super comfortable and light shoes. Perfect for casual walking.Overall these shoes run narrow but will fit you. most defiantly with puma always order a half size up so if you are a 9 order a 9.5.
"
24687,"
These are a very nice pair of sneakers from Puma. Since they are Suede, I thought they might degrade if i get them wet. Which did happen, but give them enough time to dry and they will retain their original look. Laces are too long so I invested in a pair of short laces. Other than that, they have been working really good for me. I wear them almost the whole day in college and they certainly are comfortable for long use.

My husband is a very picky person when it comes to cloths and shoes. It really is hit or miss when getting him a gift! So he needed a new pair of casual shoes, and I thought these would be great. I checked 2 of his other pairs for the size, and got him one size too big! Exchanging them was EXTREMELY easy and within two days he had his perfect fitting shoes and loves them! They even come with another pair of dark shoe laces. Overall a great choice and he says they are rather comfy too!

I’ve gotten these in stores the last two times I’ve bought them. They’re $70 in stores and I would give them five stars at that price. Super durable, comfortable and long lasting. I found them for $23 on here after shipping one day. Doesn’t get much better than that!

I bought this for my son he's not a outgoing person but the few times he wore this everyone asked him if they were custom made. He loves these shoe he bought shirts and pants to match the colours and practically wears these more than his shelltops adidas, Jordon's or Nikes. I order a few more pairs as he is so drawn to these shoes. he says they are comfortable in everyway, worth every $ spent.

This is my second pair of Puma suedes I've had in the past few years. These seem to be a bit wider and the suede is not quite as ""suedey"" as my previous ones. My only beef really is that the laces are far too long.
"

Love the shoes, if only Amazon or the vendor would read these reviews, which I doubt ever occurs, and let myself and others know where the second set of laces are going. Pumas have always come  with two pair.

Really nice shoe at a great price.  There seems to be more than one version of Puma suede as this version does not seem to have as much padding in the tongue as another pair that I have in another color.  But these were on sale at less than $25., So, at that price these are great.
"
24697,"
Cute, fits as expected and as other reviewers have said, be careful because the red dye wears onto other things (socks, the white swooshy design ...). Not for athletic use, just as a cute shoe it does the job!
"

shoes are amazing they feel amazing. I've read a couple reviews saying that the suede on people's  shoes has worn and torn very easily so hopefully that doesn't happen to me LOL but the box came like not destroyed but there were two large holes in the top of it but otherwise everything was great and the shoes are great so I recommend these so far .
"
24699,"
Have to put gel inserts in these for them to be comfortable to my likely. Other than that they are very good and I must say I've never received so many compliments on my shoes than I have with these. Not sure if it's cause they're pumas or the color is pretty rad but at least 10 comments from every gender, race and age. Good purchase. Bought another pair just recently.
"

There are are few luxuries on this planet that can compare to good-looking, comfortable, long-lasting shoes.  After having had these shoes for about half a year, my only true gripe is that the suede collects a lot of dirt and the shoes, while still wicked comfortable, are increasingly less and less presentable.  But maybe that's what a shoe is supposed to be -- protection from the dirt.  Either way, I'd go back and repeat the process again if I had to.
"
24701,"
Got them today, great fit. Feels good, lots of cushion. Although I thought they came with an extra pair of laces. While it’s not a problem I’m not a fan of the fat laces.
"
24702,"
My 3rd pair of these shoes. The color combo (grey with white stripes) goes with pretty much everything and looks quite good. When I buy new denim, the suede stains easily, but not the fault of the shoe really. New denim often bleeds color for a bit. They break in quickly and are quite comfy.

The only thing im disappointed about in these shoes is on the picture in the description they appear to be of a lighter shade (baby blue) of blue than the ones i actually received.  Mine are almost a royal blue.. Not that dark but almost.  I can only presume the lighting in the photo made me assume i was getting a slightly different color...Quite disappointing 😔😔😔

Puma.  Love it.  This blue is EXACTLY what I wanted...true to picture (but prettier in person).  They come with fat white laces as well as the blue ones.  The puma mark is cream.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  They fit as expected...I wear a 9 women, so ordered a 7.5 men... most of them on amazon are marked as both...if not, order 1 1/2 sizes down to get a women's size and with Puma that normally works.  These are good quality. I want more LOL

Always loved Puma as a kid to play basketball in.  Saw these and thought the price was rally good. They arrived within 3 days.  At first wasn't so sure about the color scheme - comes with both black laces and white laces - ended up opting for the white and loved the look.  Took these to Florida to visit my Dad - he is a walker and I walk with him.  Walked close to 5 miles a day in these and barely knew I had anything on my feet.  Really comfortable.

I haven't owned PUMAs in years.  I missed them and Love owning them!  But my feet are wider now and these shoes are definitely not for the wide of foot - everything fits fine except in the toes - they are just a tiny bit too narrow.

These are the like a super hot chick of shoes, they look fantastic, slick and sexy.  When you first but them on its like yeah I could wear these for life but after a few hours with them you can't wait to get home and take them off and leave them in a different room.Seems all the shoe manufactures have gone to these thin narrow shoes that look almost like boat shoes.  I can't find anything like the old Van's from the 90's with the fat tongue, those where super comfortable.

I have flat feet and spend all day standing on my feet at work. I can wear these easily and don't have to worry about having sore feet. They look great really nice and bright.

Very cute color and material. Versatile to wear during any season (except snow of course) and it fits well and isnt too tight which is a plus especially since I have fat feet. I didnt give it five stars because I havent walked all day in it yet so will post about full day comfortability later

I couldn't tell from the pictures what color the accent was (in some pictures it looked red, others it was orange-ish and other it was even pink-ish) - for your information, it's red. Overall, I'm happy with these shoes, but not sure yet how they will hold up.

I really like these Puma Suede Classic sneakers, but the sizing is definitely narrow. I wear a US size 9-1/2M or European size 43 Birkenstocks, Clarks, Sidi, BMW, Timberland, and other premium men's shoes. I'll exchange these size 10 for a 10-1/2

This is the classic Puma suede sneaker. Decent quality and fits as expected. I find these shoes are far more fashion than function.

These are classic suede sneakers with no frills, no strange, aggressive tread, no bizarro color scheme.  They are from a time when there weren't a lot of specialized shoes for every single activity you can think of. One possible downside:  the cushioning inside is soft (nice!) but with little arch support (less nice).  They are thin and light.  I wouldn't run a 5K race in these,  but they are absolutely fantastic for casual wear and driving.

I got matching shoes for my husband and I (I know, so cheesy) and the are both GREAT! I got our usual sizes (6M and 9.5M) and they both fit us perfectly. The suede is good quality.

This is a fantastic looking shoe and really comfy as well. The midsole is soft enough without feeling squishy, so walking around all day in these feels great.

To start off, this is a comfortable,trendy, and stylish shoe. my personal experience may differ from yours. I have had the shoe 3 months ( bought in August 2017)of wear for every other day as my school, and hang out attire. Sadly today the” still has decent thickness” sole just split under my feet leaving me confused about the build quality of the shoe. I am at but of disappointment beacause 3 months was not what I expected these would last, especially for my light wear, I expected the good half of a year or two at the very least. And I’m stuck with the shoes on until I get home being as I’m at school.

They are perfect. No stores had the red ones. I order so much from Amazon so I thought I would check just for giggles. He was so happy they had them. I was nervous when it said size D Mens medium.

Love these shoes! I got men’s size 6.5 since women’s shoes tend to run too narrow for me. I’m usually an 8.5 W, and these fit perfectly! Might take a bit of breaking in but otherwise they’re comfortable.

Got this for my big bro, and he loves it, it looks even better when you rock it with a fitting outfit.He specifically wanted something light and comfortable. Now, while this isn't the lightest shoe ever, it was still light enough tho.

My son bought these for his dad on his birthday as a surprise, my husband wears a size 12.5 to a 13 but these shoes are somewhat tight on his feet. I recommend you go up a 1/2 size from the largest shoe you wear. Other than that both my son and husband love the shoe.

These are comfortable and stable shoes. They are long lasting. The color is great!

The color is great and I love the suede fabric. I bought them a half a size up based on other reviews and it was a good call. The reason why I didn't give 5 stars is the stitching is a little off on the right shoe so it rubs my foot a little. Overall satisfied.

Always loved the style and it is timeless.  High quality and the blue is unique.  I'll be watching for this same shoe/color with a gum drop sole.  I think that would be super cool.

No buyers remorse here! At this price, you can't go wrong. I can afford to buy a lot more to match all of my outfits. I've gotten a lot of complements on them. They look very expensive. They are so worth it. They shipped super fast. I got them in 2 days.

First time trying these shoes since the early 70's and Clyde the Guide so what goes around comes around.  I have a wide foot and was only slightly worried these may run tight but several commented that they stretched out in short order.  To my pleasant surprise they fit like a glove right out of the box and I can't wait to show them off to my brother when I visit soon.  I think my nephew will be most impressed.
"

Size ran a little larger than usual. My son likes Puma, so this is not the first pair I bought for him. Even though it runs a little large, they still look great on him & he decided to keep them since his feet are still growing.

Just came in all are perfect condition but the white ones you could see some of the glue by the midsole but it's barely visible and it's not leather like I thought it's made out of a cloth matter is but all in all great purchase

There are super nice. They last a long time and the soles do not pick up dirt so they are staying looking nice over time. I will buy several more pairs in different colors.

I owned a pair of clydes back in the day, and these fit exactly the same, a bit narrow in the ball of the foot, but wear in like slippers and very comfortable. My only gripe would be that they don't make the shamrock models anymore (the green variety) as I would buy them in a heartbeat.
"
24828,"
I bought these for a 40 year class reunion because that's what I wore in high school. I guess over the last 40 years the shoe industry has come leaps and bounds in foot comfort. These look great and are well made...but they feel like Converse on your feet!

I have always loved the Puma Suede series.. I love these even more since I got them for $20! Pumas always run about a half size small so remember to size up half a size.

I ordered these by accident, and I couldn't be happier with them.  Good fit, comfortable, and I love the red color.  I was super bummed when something cut the suede on the right shoe, but I like them so much I'm going to order a new pair.
"
24831,"
I love this shade of blue. I do have a somewhat high arch and I think that's what makes them a little snug, but I'm guessing that once I've worn them a few times they'll get worked in nicely.

I like the retro look of the suede pumas i have another pairs in Grey and cabernet, you have to go a half size bigger, i already have big feet so they do look big, not much support inside, but i always throw in a scholl insole, into all my sneakers no matter what brand.
"
24835,"
These are listed as and I thought I bought a pair of size twelve wide shoes, but they are rather narrow for my feet. I don't want to return them and my feet are weird anyway so a bit of complicated lacing was enough to get a basic fit, but I can't recommend buying shoes online from this.
"

Hubby loves them but says they aren't the same fit as his other 2 pair. He already has Red and Blue.
"

My only complaint is that it did not come with white laces as a second option. I prefer to go with white lace shoes in black sneakers. I bought some white laces locally, but it would have been better if the product provided this option out of the box.

I bought these for my husband and he was thrilled! He is a pretty big Puma fan anyway so finding all black ones he could wear to work was great.

This is the fifth pair of Puma Suede Classics that I have ordered on Amazon (I have 5 different color schemes). These are completely consistent in terms of fit. The actual colors typically look much better than they appear in the iffy photos online. They are comfortable, if you know what to expect...obviously, do not expect cushiony running shoes.

A beautiful sneaker. They fit pretty well, though the heel support on the right sneaker is rigid and rubbed my ankle. After loosening the ankle support a few times, they feel fine. All in all I like them a lot.

My boyfriend is a size 11 and the size runs bigger. A 10.5 would of been perfect size. Keep in mind when ordering your size.

This is a very nice shoe. I always need to buy Puma shoes a size larger than I normally wear and these were no exception. They have held up very well in the few months I have been wearing them. I'm not sure I would wear them for anything more than a leisurely stroll though.
"
24847,"
Yes!!! They come with the fat, white laces...and they rock!  A true classic that never goes out of style.  I love these shoes so much that I ALWAYS make sure to have a decent pair on-hand.  They're a little snug for my size (13) but stretch out within a few days.  As long as Puma keeps making them, I will always buy them.

These are the first pair of Pumas that I've owned and I've found them to be great shoes. Very comfortable, though still not quite broken in after only 4 or 5 wears. With a firmer tongue than many similar style shoes, these Pumas have a premium feel relative to the inexpensive price.
"
24855,"
I had this pare a couple years back and loved them. Once you wear them in they are as comfortable as socks! The materials and craftsmanship is really good for a shoe that's around $50. I decided to rebuy them and I wasn't disappointed.  Fit's great. Even for having wide feet. If you too are like me just wait a week they should conform nicely to your foot :) I'll probably buy these again next year.

These are FAKE FAKE FAKE.  Counterfeit.  Knock-offs.Only one set of laces, and not the fat ones.  Real Puma Suede's come with white and dark laces.Gold stamping can be rubbed off and is blotchy compared to a sharp REAL Puma logo/ SUEDE/ Springing Puma on the heel.The suede blotches with exposure to water.  This has NEVER happened on any genuine Puma I've ever owned in the past 20 years.  The suede feels cheap, brittle and stiff.Not nearly as comfortable out-of-the-box as the genuine PUMAS.  Narrow feeling, pinch the pinky toe.I mean, they're shoes.  I can wear them and they look OK.  But if they last 1/4 as long as real PUMAs, I'll be shocked.  I've worn other Puma Suedes for 365+ days in a row without issue.  We'll see about these.Because of all of the above, I'll NEVER order shoes from Amazon again.
"

Love these shoes. It's been months and they're still holding together quite nicely. I'm one of ""those guys"" to have the same shoes until they're beat to pulp and then I move on to the next pair. Aside from that I'm not huge shoe guy, so all I can really say is that I like the style and that they are far from cheaply made.

I bought these because they were on sale and they looked pretty cool. I was very excited when I got them. I put them on and instantly noticed how uncomfortable they were. I made sure the laces were pretty loose and tried again, still uncomfortable. I will give them a little longer before I say they are awful but I remember Puma's being a lot more comfortable a decade ago.Also, I normally wear a 13 (US) but I had to buy 14 (US). Puma seems to make them a little small.
"
24876,"
I love the color and size of these.Two issues I have are both product defects that make me think these are factory rejects.1. Where the sole is glued on to the top-sole there is a line of darker purple that looks like it was where the sole was intended to be glued.2. On the left shoe, there is a sewing defect on the inside of the big toe where the seam is. There is a thick patch there that rubs a bit.
"

These are very stylish, however with all shoes (maybe just suede) the toes get indented and stay like that if you happen to leave something on them or someone steps on your toes. I don't really have any other issues with them.

Great shoes. I am a US size 9 but, after reading other reviews of the size being a bit off due to the shoe shape, I ordered a half size bigger, 9.5. These fit perfect and are comfortable. If you are skeptic about the size, order a half size larger and if you think they are too big, you can always return them for free and get your desired size.
"

What can I say.. They look amazing and this colour hands down is the best colour Puma has to offer in this style.  Get compliments on these all the time.  They fit me perfectly in length and width.

Probably the best shoes I have owned in a while. Great fit, looks nice, and they aren't ""skater shoes"". I will note that after some time the white rubber around the shoe turning yellow and getting brittle; however, this is expected, since I have owned these shoes for over 2 years!

I ordered a half size bigger because all the reviews said they ran small. They fit OK but I'm very disappointed because all the reviews said  the sneakers come with colored and white laces.

A tad bit tight for true to size but I considered that they never been worn and needed to stretch just a little little bit. Otherwise perfect

They fit a little small, but they are wearable, and maybe will break in and stretch out a little. Nice looking sneakers, but one thing bugs me, the color is 'beetroot purple', but everyone says it looks like pink. I'm not a pink sneaker kind of guy. It's hard to get the perfect sneaker. Need a pair for the gym (Nikes), a pair for home (Pumas), a pair for the office (Vans). Every time I buy a pair, I want another.

i'm old enough to have worn the original suede pumas.  also wore them again when they brought them back in the early 90s.  this incarnation is not good.  even at the $25 i paid, i couldn't justify keeping them.  they seem like a cheaper version that would be made for an outlet store...the suede is thin, the tongue and collar are too padded and the sole is really soft and hollow.looking at the pics of puma's other reissues, these don't look like an isolated case.  the romas and ligas look bad too.  it's a shame that a company like puma feels the need to cut so many corners even at $50-60 retail.  not expecting heirloom quality here but i doubt these would last more than a few months.

get a half size bigger. if its a tiny bit too big? get a cheap insole I got a dr. sholls, and now its more comfortable and fit is perfect. I wear a 8,.5 in everything, a 9.5 in nike and puma I guess.

Cool looking shoes... Too narrow. My feet typically require Nike Wides or Asics (they are generally wider). Anyhow, the style is cool, the shoes are padded and have ridiculous cushioning. Worth the money.

I have purchased Puma shoes in the past, therefore, I knew what exact size to purchase.  Puma suede shoes are my all time favorite.  I enjoy this sneaker's style and comfort.

Ordered mens US 10 and found the shoe roomy but a bit too loose so I opted for the US 9.5.  Felt snug and comfortable until after 4 hours then it got a little tight in the toe-box.

Can't praise Puma's enough. I tried other competing brands that looked nice but was way too narrow and tight.  They also had no support which started screwing up my arch and calves.

"
25085,"
These shoes look really good and they even feel good ... at first.  After wearing them for a couple hours I could feel blisters forming on my feet.  The lining around the opening of the shoe is really to prevent your foot from slipping, but if these shoes don't fit just right then you can expect them to slowly rub you raw or give you blisters wherever that lining sits on your feet.  Luckily I bought these with weight lifting in mind as they have a good flat sole, but I can't wear them for longer than about an hour at a time without starting to feel some pain.

The photos make these look like a deep red color. They are not. The color is more like a pinkish red, closer to salmon than cherry. Anyway, these were replacements for an older pair of Puma Suedes. The old ones have leather trim on the upper part of the lining, also the tongue, and the footbed is very firm. These are none of those things: cloth everywhere, and the footbed feels like... Vans.

My son loved these shoes and said they were quite comfortable. After daily wear, it should be noted that baby toes will poke through the suede on the sides. I think we got 4 months out of his pair. I consider this below average since he didn't grow out of them. Nice looking shoes, however with good inside cushioning made them a very comfortable shoe for daily wear.

When I found this shoe, with such a great price and selection, I figured I'd take a shot at buying a pair of shoes online (something I'd never do) knowing with Amazon's excellent customer service I could send them back if there was a problem.

I have to break them in... but unfortunately they seem to be breaking my feet in instead. They are tight in weird places, where your foot comes out at the joints, yet I have a rather slender/narrow foot. So I was a little disappointed in the fit. I've only worn them once because they are uncomfortable, but the next size up would probably be too big.

There's only 3 (reliable) brands of sneakers I buy. The other two I won't name but it's Puma first, then the other two when I want a new pair. Personally, I feel that it doesn't make any sense to make a sneaker full of exotic colors or fancy designs if the quality of the sneaker stinks.

So far so good !  I've never worn Puma sneakers before, but always admired the styling of them.  After reading many reviews, I took the plunge.  I've only worn them a few days, but so far they are really comfortable, fit as expected, and are very nice looking and appear to be well made.

GREAT SHOES! These are classically stylish. More importantly, they are excellently supportive and have great cushioning. Many similarly styled shoes have no arch support and have terrible cushioning so I was pleasantly surprised by these shoes. I've gotten them a little wet a few times, and they handle it well. I will buy these again.

Definitely get a half size smaller than what you are!  I'm a 9 and these left a huge gap in the back heel portion.  Thank god they still felt comfortable and didn't slip off while walking or else I'd have to return them.  But they're definitely comfortable and of course good looking!

Buying this pair of sneakers takes me back to the 80's and makes me smile whenever I put them on.  They fit well and I act like I did in the 80's, I do not wear them in the rain and I have a brush for them.  These are exactly what I was looking for.

I have worn these shoes for one week. Mostly indoors, and in dry conditions to and from work. The interior sole is already falling apart, the sides are discolored, and they are starting to smell bad. When I first opened them I thought they looked faded (compared to the exact same pair of shoes I already own and which lasted me six months) but I assumed that my old shoes had somehow gotten darker. I have now come to the conclusion that this seller is laundering old shoes and selling them as new. I have had many pairs of Pumas over the years and have never had these problems, even after months of wear. In fact the identical six month old pair doesn't even look or smell as bad as these after only one week. Buyer beware.

You have to understand that you are buying these sneakers for their retro look.  If you are in the market for a sneaker for an activity or your main everyday shoe, don't buy these.  However, for an occasion they make a statement.

I've had about 20 pairs of Pumas and never had a problem. The picture shows leather on the inside of the tongue and shoe, but the two pairs I recently received have puffy fabric lining the inside. Mine don't fit because the puffy fabric makes them tight on the inside.  I didn't realize this at the time so I kept them, thinking they were tight because they were not broken in yet. By the time I realized the problem was with the shoe and not me, the return window had closed and I'm left with sneakers that don't fit.

I ordered these shoes online and received them promptly. At first glance the shoes looked awesome. I tried them on and they fit well, i wore them for a day and the right shoe fit a little snug, the left shoe fit perfect. I hoped that the shoe would stretch so i wore them again with thinner socks and the shoes killed my toes. I decided to return the defective shoes and hoped that i could exchange them for a bigger size. I tried to contact the seller and explain my issue, they weren’t helpful at all. So I paid for the return shipping to return the shoes and was charged a restocking fee and now I’m out the shipping fee, restocking fee, a pair of shoes. Never again...

This must be the sixth pair of identical shoe that I've bought over the past two or three years. I wore previous pairs of this shoe on daily 4-mile walks on a variety of asphalt, concrete and gravel surfaces, including some fairly rough streets in three of India's largest cities. The earlier pairs lasted a year before developing holes in the soles. This most recent pair I took on similar walks on Martha's Vineyard's tame pavement and I developed holes in the soles after four weeks. You can see straight through the heel of each shoe. I am not buying these again.

I'm pretty disappointed in this pair of Pumas. Right out of the box, the left shoe fit properly, but the right shoe was tight in the front half.

Pumas are way too expensive to fall apart this quickly.

It's unfortunate that I have to give these a bad review, as they're really nice-looking shoes. They would be perfectly fine if it weren't for the long and sharp tongue. When I tried to walk around in these, they kept digging into the top of my foot when I wore low socks.Other people have mentioned this, so it's not just a problem with the ones I got. The apparent solution is to wear long socks, but those don't look great with shorts. I'm regretfully slapping a UPS label on these and sending them back to Amazon. Oh well.

You cannot go wrong with a classic! I've ordered these at least 5 times, all different colors and they are always a please! I rock them with the thin laces, not the fat (they come with 2 pairs).

It's classic, it's clean, its a little more blue in person - which is actually okay - it might just be that i'm wearing blue so it looks blue. These are not fancy and do not stand out. if you are into that, they are really good lounging shoes.

I have been wearing Adidas Gazelle and Campus models for taijiquan (tai chi chuan) practice for many years.  I particularly like the Gazelle model because the soles are a soft, flat rubber with minimal tread pattern that allows you to do the heel and toe spins in taiji without binding to the ground too much.  One issue with the Gazelles is they are rather narrow and I sometimes feel some instability in balance or like I am almost falling off the edge of the sole.  The Campus model is slightly wider but the tread pattern is stickier, plus availability and price  seems to be an issue nowadays.  I decided to try this Puma version of the suede sneaker.  The good news: the sole is a soft rubber pretty similar to that on Gazelles.  I went with size 10s because the red ones happened to be heavily discounted; I wear 9.5 in Adidas but my feet are beginning to edge into the 10 zone so...  As it happens the Puma Suede Classic size 10 fits me very well and even turns out to have a bit more room in the toe box (possibly because of the larger size) than my Adidas shoes. The bad news: the Puma sole feels nice and thick under the heel but is surprisingly thin under the balls of the feet!  These will work well for taijiquan (for a while?) but otherwise I will use them more like Converse Chuck Taylors or One Stars: for driving and errands that don't require much walking or standing.  The extra set of white laces had been stolen - left in the box were the two empty little plastic bags.  Amazon should crack down on this pilfering!

I hate buying a pair of sneakers online that seem like such a great bargain, then they come in the mail and seem stiff, without any comfortable padding, and they just seem like terrible knock offs. I mean, the inside bottom sole isn't cushioned at all, and the sides walls of the sneaker aren't soft or cushioned at all either. Then it hits you, this is why these sneakers were cheap. BUT...these Pumas are not those cheaply made ones. The look great, they are truly classic Puma suede, and feel awesome on my feet. They are soft and padded nicely on the inside around the ankle and on the sole. As I stated in the headline, for $29.99, I should have bought multiple pairs! I love the grey/white look. I was watching these last year, and they dropped from $60 to $39. I wanted to purchase them last year, but didn't, and I was heart broken to see later that the price jumped back up to $60. My wife and I were sitting on the couch before this past Christmas, and she pointed out to me, ""aren't these the sneakers you were looking at awhile ago?"" She pointed out the incredible $29.99 price drop, and I ""clicked to buy"" immediately! If they offer them in other colors, still at that price, I might just get more!  In case you are wondering, I highly recommend these to any Puma lover, or anyone who loves great sneakers.  **Please note, I marked that these fit as expected. They fit as expected for a Puma sneaker. I have wide D sized foot. Pumas run a wee bit on the narrow side. These still fit great though**

I bought the blue and the gold and love them. As usual, they fit about 1/2 size large. I ordered the black ones after being rather surprised to see that they were back in stock following a long period of deadstock. The shoes I received were the ""Natural Calm"" style that can be found elsewhere on the site. They're not solid black though, they have a grey stripe and a cream colored outsole. The ""Natural Calm"" shoes list for $65, so if they haven't fixed the glitch yet and you're interested in buying them, just buy these tonal black ones and you can get a deal.Update: After I returned the wrong pair I received, it appeared that they fixed the problem because the black colorway suddenly had almost no sizes available. Then, about a month later, I looked and saw that a size 13 was in stock on Amazon marketplace. Occasionally a deadstock shoe will become available in one or more sizes when an outside seller lists whatever is leftover from their store. So naturally I thought that's what happened and was sure that I would get the real thing this time. Wrong. I received the same shoes as before-the ""Natural Calm"" edition which I included a photo of the last time. Very frustrating. And what's really frustrating is that they actually still make this shoe because if you look on the European website for Puma.com, it's one of the main colorways they sell (along with red/white, blue/white, and black/white). However they won't ship to the US. I just wish Amazon would order some more from the manufacturer. And yes I know there is a similar shoe sold here called Puma Suede LFS, but I already own a pair.In short, DO NOT buy the black ones unless you want the shoe in the picture I have provided.

Classic Puma shoes. very nostalgic. the look. the cut. the colors. all 5-star. like steppin into the 80's..( reason for 4 stars below )Fit :1) these are very Tight fitting. or i should say very Exact fitting (they arent tight in all the wrong places like Cheap sneakers are...they are very well designed, so they are tight all over. and hlthe Toe room is non existant if you purchase.your normal size(s)...i take a 9&1/2(usa) and normal width, in mens for 80% of sneakers.. the other 20% I take a size 10....i purchased the size 10 of these...and...they Just fit..and by just i mean they are on the very of being to short.and to tight.  i would definitly bug a 10&1/2 (usa) size next time (and if offered a slightly wider width)...BUT..i will be buying more..2) Comfort...this is an area that im a little confused on.. like most things that are.considered classic or retro. normally when they are Updated for today..they see improvemnt in key areas.. and the one thing about Puma's from the 80's till today...is that they arount very cushioned . you put them on and they dont feel like they are meant to soft on the inside.. and its kinda sad..with just some better insoles they would be an all around perfect sneaker (if you buy the Corrrect size)All in all i gobe the product 95 out of 100..  the Size i can buy larger...but they should atleast offer a Option for a more comfortable insole... (yeah i can buy a seperate insole from another company like Dr Shoals..but i shouldnt have to)

Back in the early 80's i was a pure bonafide B-Boy, cazal glasses, kangol bucket hat, dark non washed rough lee denim jeans, lee denim jacket, bvd shirts, lacoste and vintage le tigre shirts, leather bombers, grey, burgundy and beige sheepskin jackets, members only jacket,belt buckle with my name on it, huge boombox lasonic radio, tons of breakdancing, adidas superstars, nike navy cortez original, and last but not least my all time #1 favorite the suede pumas preferably burgundy with superfat laces and a sock rolled up into a square and placed under the tongue of all the sneakers to make them look tough, anyone looking to buy these sneakers you cant go wrong, this review is for the cabernet color which is really burgundy so dont get confused, i own 5 colors right now and will probably buy 5 more for the collection, the comfort is unbealivable, the colors on the suede are extremely well done and on point, i suggest buy half size smaller on the adult versions and half size bigger on the kids, my kids have 6 pairs between them and they love them just as my wife has a few also, i am a sneaker collecter and i started buying these again in early 2000's but were a little hard to find but i am glad they got them in production with tons of colors now, i just received the all beige and white last week and i only wore them once ( since i have about 100 pair of snakers☺) and i could not believe how many compliments i got on how beautiful that color was on the sneakers( chinchilla and white) also tons of compliments in the cabernet ""burgundy"", dont sleep on these timeless classics!!!!

What I liked about this product/shoe was the color as well as the appearance of the shoe. I purchased them to match my spouses shoe. She ordered a pair of high top Puma, white with a blue Puma emblem. We wore these shoes on our wedding day and that was very special to be able to wear comfortable shoes on your wedding day and not the ol' traditional dress shoe or converses.

I ordered these shoes and only read reviews afterwards. I cannot speak to the negative reviews previously posted, but can report that I am thoroughly pleased with my pair. I visited an official Puma store to inspect the genuine article before mine arrived. The green and white box is a variation that was mixed in plain sight in the store alongside the orange and white one. The pair of these shoes on display in store had the mesh tongue/padding; the pair brought out in my size at the Puma store had the leather tongue/lining. While the salesperson couldn’t explain the difference, it is obvious that both variants are in fact genuine Puma shoes. The pair I received from Amazon came in a green box (with the odd manufacturer’s label/sticker inside the box); they have the mesh tongue/liner, are perfectly crafted, all stitching clean, straight and symmetrical; the box was a bit banged around from shipping but the shoes were firmly and tightly wrapped in tissue paper, the toes filled with tissue and the tongues sheathed in plastic. The color is spot on and the fit is excellent, and they are very comfortable. I would absolutely order these shoes from Amazon again!

For myself the fit was correct and comfortable. However, I gave it 4 stars knowingly that the tongue tag of green Puma and white cat on black background is not as the 1970’s era original. Puma’s “jr” size shoes have the white cat and lettering on the tongue like I had back in the day. Still, I desired the nostalgic look and checks the box!Now if I could find an imitation  “Kangol”type hat with imitation beaver skin, my look would be complete.

I wore these Puma sneakers when I was a kid and loved them back then and still do. These sneakers are from a time awhile ago when things were much better. These shoes are comfy enough to wear for quite awhile, tho maybe a bit tighter than similar sneakers I wear from other brands, but not enough to cause any pain. I got size 11 and that's usually the sneaker size I wear and these fit me just fine, but again maybe a tiny bit narrower than other sneakers I wear or wore over the years, but still a 5 star sneaker to me. Suede top with decent rubber soles and these sneakers remind me of Air Walk sneakers I wore maybe 20 years ago....well the soles do at least. Great low-priced sneakers that I like wear most of the day with no problems and tho not exercise sneakers, you can at least take a good walk in them for awhile. I'd go 1/2 size up if you wear thicker socks tho as I said before, these sneakers seems a touch narrow. I ordered another pair of those blue/white Puma sneakers.
"
25419,"
This is probably not the seller's fault, I had a puma classic that I bought a couple of years ago, the padding at the back of sneakers was of cloth material and filled with sponge. These new ones apperently do not have that, first day I wore them I felt like my feet were rubbing on concrete, it scracted my skin in a couple of places and even the socks had stains of blood from my feet on them, had them get them fitted with padding so I can wear them comfortably.Don't know what puma changed with the style or design and comfort level of these shoes but it definitely is not a comfortable who on its own without some heavy adjustments. Not like the super comfortable puma suede they made a couple of years ago
"

I've always liked these shoes.  They're colorful, comfortable, inexpensive and look good.  The only thing I don't like is that the tag on the inside of the tongue scratches your feet, unless you're wearing socks.  If PUMA would fix this, they would be perfect, but now the only solution is to cut out the tag.Update:  I ordered another pair and there doesn't seem to be any improvement with the tag.  They came with 2 pairs of laces, in different colors, but one pair is very wide, unfortunately.  I'm not a fan of super-wide laces, but they at least had the good sense to make the more narrow pair, the more difficult color to obtain.  The super-wide pair is white, which can easily be replaced anywhere you can find laces.I see many comments on the sizing being small, but I don't know that I agree.  They may be just slightly narrow, but I wear the same size as I do with Nike athletic shoes.  In contrast, I have to size up with New Balance shoes.  Since dress shoes run larger then athletic shoes, they're obviously smaller then most dress shoes.
"
25421,"
If I'm being honest, the quality of the shoe itself is probably closer to a 4 star rating. However, the nostalgia factor boosts it up to a 5 star rating for me. I used to wear these shoes back in the 80s and I loved them! I decided to pick up a pair to see if they would fit and rock them as a throwback. The reason I wasn't sure if they would fit is that my typical shoe size definitely includes a 3E width and these only come in D(Medium). However, I'm happy to say that because of the way they are designed, once I loosened the laces, there was enough room for my foot to be comfortable in these. They are a bit snug when I put on athletic no-show socks. So for now I'm wearing them without socks but I'm going to look for a thinner style of sock going forward.They really do look nice and my wife and daughter gave me a thumbs up on them :-)All I need now are some parachute pants or two-tone jeans to go with them. LOL

I have wide feet (toes more so than heels), so I was worried these wouldn't fit. However, they fit great, and they're very comfortable. Not too narrow in the toe area, and I really like the padding around the heel. I was initially impressed by the built quality for these relatively inexpensive shoes, and as they broke in and became even more comfortable, they quickly became my favorite casual shoes.Unfortunately, the soft rubber soles have worn down very rapidly, much more wear than I've had with other sneakers, and in less than 5 months, the right sole has split open across the ball of the foot where the wear is most severe. The left sole is almost as badly worn in that area. I could have stepped on something, but it seems like it was bound to happen given the wear rate.In spite of this, I think I will buy a new pair and give them another shot. They're just so comfortable and they fit my sense of style -- and the price isn't so bad even if they don't last as long as I'd expected.

Looks are great. But if you have wide feet(even though the shoes are for wide feet.) get something else.
"

Update: the size 11 1/2"" fit a little better -they are still very narrow in the toe, however. They aren't uncomfortable like the 11's we're, and should loosen up a little the more I wear them.(Original review) These have been my go-to shoe for ages. HOWEVER, the last time I bought them (2 years ago), they had leather lining in the heel, and the tongue. And I bought size 11. I bought a new pair a week or so ago, and they are fabric lined, and the 11's were waaaaayy too tight. In fact the left shoe was tighter in the toe than the right.

These seem comfortable right out of the box and look good.  I had a hard time deciding what size to order based on the reviews, I try and avoid the order two sizes, return one situation if I can.  I have a few Puma athletic/cross training type sneakers which are size 10 and are fairly tight fitting but certainly not enough to consider going up a half size, so for me Puma's tend to run a little small.  Often I am a 9.5 in other shoes. Compared to the other Puma sneakers, these have a tad more room but there isn't enough that I would go down a size.  These sneakers have less padding and thinner material being more a lifestyle sneaker compared to an athletic sneaker.  I would say if you have experience with other shoes from Puma order the same size, if not then I think you will likely want to order a half size larger from your normal size for these.

They would have been unwearable if I had not used a pocket knife to gouge out a hardened bit of glue or something that was in the toe area of the show putting pressure on two toes. It was twice as large as a pea. The soles are full of hollow pockets that are just sized perfectly for gravel to dig into, once it does any small amount of water will seep through the bottom of the shoe. The soles under the balls of my feat ballooned out a bit. I really wanted to like these better.

Cool shoes. They are basic, versatile & have a timeless style. I really like the royal blue color. I'm glad Amazon sells shoes! Good price & free two day shipping. My only complaint would be the sizing; they are a bit narrow. I normally wear a 10-10.5, I got these in a 10.5 & they are a little tight. The length is fine but where the widest part of your foot goes, they are a little tight. Bear in mind, I just got these, so they should break-in & become more comfortable. I will keep these but if they were just a half size smaller I would return them & if I order another pair, I will get an 11. TO SUMMARIZE-- THESE ARE GREAT CASUAL WALKING SHOES, BUT THEY ARE A BIT NARROW, SO IF YOUR FEET ARE EVEN A LITTLE WIDE, I WOULD ORDER A FULL SIZE UP.

I got these for work.  In order to streamline my everyday life I decided to wear clothes only from one brand.  I thought this plan would free mine mind to concentrate on the important issues of the day.  I adapted this concept from Einstein who wore the same outfit everyday.  I selected puma for its breadth of clothing.  The brand could supply my workwear, casual wear, and with some adaptation and imagination everything else in between.  I've since abandoned this single brand philosophy as my wife found it very restrictive and I cause her enough problems as it is.  She was annoyed that I was wearing compression wear for bed, she didn't like me wearing a puma webbing belt with a pre-existing suit.  She didn't like my exhaustive search for a puma-branded tie.I have now returned to a wardrobe of mixed brands, a happier wife, and I still maintain these shoes.

I had to add an insolvent du to shoe edge kinda digs into your arch. with the additional and some break in they are the best value in my retro 80's shoe comparison. I compared to original reproductions from the era by REEBOK, PUMA, Adidas and Asics. Nike never fit me right on any era. If you're looking for old school simple flat shoes try Addidas Men's Advantage Running Shoe, Adidas Originals Men's Seeley Running Shoe, and PUMA Men's Suede Classic + Sneaker for similar styles.  the Adidas Mens Advantage gets a bit warm on the foot over time so if you live somewhere hot skip those.

These are ""interesting"" the reason I say ""interesting"" is they look good - cept the Puma strip is a odd tan colour - not white which I was expecting - been wearing them a couple of days & their all day comfy - not the most comfy I've ever worn - but not bad. The colour Red is brilliant - they also come with two set's of laces - a heavy Red set & a lighter White set - I went with the white set - pretty sharp shoes - driving wise ( I drive a Mini Cooper with a manual transmission) there fine - I have a after market peddle kit installed & these grab the peddles nicely - no issue with slippage etc - def worth the $29 which they were posted for on Amazon.

Read some reviews about some buyers getting knock-offs, so I purchased with some skepticism.  I luckily received the genuine article for use in my Vegas wedding.  Next to a 1955 Diamond Blue Thunderbird, these shoes fit so perfectly I almost distracted people's eyes from the car, but my beautiful wife clearly got the most attention.I love the look of the shoes.  Sizing runs pretty normal, so I go a size bigger for my wide feet.  Not much arch support which is where the 4 stars comes from.  Flat feet will love these.

I work as a sign waver/street dancer approximately 5 hrs a day, 5 days a week, so I've torn through one pair and am on my second.These wear down nicely- the soles are solid rubber in the front and can get pretty thin before they break. The rubber doesn't peel away at the sides when you squat like converse-types do, and well worth the price over $10 payless shoes. They feel tight for the first few days, but settle nicely.No rivets to dig into your feet also means harder to tighten the laces.I bought a pair of the the cheapest similar shoes at payless for $10ish when these started getting worn out- the sole wore down to a hollow section with rubber bracing at both ends in a week (keep in mind this is excessive use- lots of dragging on rough sidewalks)Photos of the payless ones, and the pumas after excessive wear

been wearing a couple times a week for a few months.  so far they've held up well.  they go great with pretty much anything, so i don't have to to think much about matching colors. only negative is they lack any kind of arch support.  they're very flat shoes, which i guess maybe skaters like, but i'm not one.  next time i may buy a half size up and get some cushion insoles.

These are amazing looking shoes, I love how they look and how the shoes themselves feel. I primarily wear them on weekends and around town. My issue is that they run a tad smaller than other brands. While this isn't a deal-breaker, I think that prevents them from being my daily wear. I'll save them for weekends and casual wear when I want to wear good looking shoes, but am not going to be walking long distances or needing to wear them for hours. Maybe consider ordering a half size larger than normal for this, but I'm happy with my purchase!

These are very solid shoes that provide style for a cheap price. With this cheap price however comes a slight hiccup in the product. For me it was the annoying narrow width around the toes and awkward padding which went away after two weeks. My experience the past 2 months with these shoes have been great besides the two weeks having the shoe mold around my feet. One big drawback about these sneakers for me though is the difference in material. The tongues of the two shoes seem look a little different but its not a deal-breaker.**PROS:-Stylish-Long Lasting-Comfy**CONS:-Takes time to break in-Narrow at first-Order a size up if you're worried about he width.

Nice suede, good looking.  Bought some Adidas suede campus sneaks that aren't nearly as nice for a little more.  The suede on the Adidas is awful looking after two or three outings.  Two complaints about this shoe.  One seems to be slightly smaller in the toe area and for whatever reason it hurts in the arch area.  But, for what I paid, they are very nice shoes.  It's likely that I just need to adjust the laces a bit more on the one side.

Might be a fake, but not sure 🤔It’s getting harder to tell a authentic shoe from a fake. Not a big concern for me, as long as they keep my feet protected. Let’s see how long they last...

These Pumas are such great shoes, and I really love the way they fit my extra wide feet.  They stretch to accommodate but I don't feel as though I'm distorting the shoe, and my feet don't feel cramped inside.  This is a great option for anyone who loves a high quality shoe that won't break the bank - and the selection of colors is great, with new styles being released often.  I already have about 6 pairs of these in my shoe wardrobe and I'm sure I'll be adding more as I go along.  I also appreciate that they come with two pairs of laces to allow the look to be customized.  My one minor complaint is that the wide laces don't seem to stay tied very well, but it could have to do with how I am tying them.  Not a concern that would give me a second's pause to buy another pair!

Great shoe, comfortable. This pair is a repeat purchase to replace my prior pair. These shoes aren't as durable as you might expect of other shoes. No problems with tears or stitching, more that the sole wears sooner than other shoes. They really feel great when new.They run a little small. For these, I go a half size up to get the right fit.

These shoes are what I expected. Not a counterfeit like I’ve read on some reviews. There was slight color fading, but it is stated in the box that it is possible.

These are a really great shade of blue and are really close to the color shown on the product page.I have a couple of these in different colors and I love the retro look just like back in high school(back in the day)when my parents couldn't afford to buy this style shoe for any of their children but we had shoes,and food in our bellies.Once I stumbled on the first pair of these I knew I had to have them just because I always loved this style with the suede and the colors.They fit well with the thinner sport socks and snug with thicker cotton/blend socks.And I don't recommend wearing these everyday as I've always heard if you can afford it buy"" really well made shoes""if you want to wear them  as an everyday shoe or have a few to several pairs of shoes to switch with that are of course comfortable and these are comfortable.I highly recommend this shoe!

Bought these for work at a university that shares similar colors and they are great.  as an everyday shoe you may want extra support from an add-in insert but they have been great so far.  Mine came with both a pair of both grey and orange laces allowing me to double lace the shoe.My one complaint was that one of the front stitching lines didn't match between both shoes on the front.  It was minor and probably just on this one right shoe but I noticed it.  No one else who isn't looking for it ever will so I just kept them.  Love suede pumas.  Such a great casual office shoe in workplaces that are ok with it.

Great looking sneaker. I’m a big fan of Puma since the 80’s with the fat shoe laces. lol For the price I don’t expect these to be top of the line footwear, but good enough to wear with a couple of outfits from time to time.

I have owned Puma Suedes before and two things I've always liked about them is that they run a bit wider than other sneakers and they fit true-to-size. Now, these shoes are brand new, so I am leaving some leeway here because I realize they will stretch out with time (but at this point they seem a little less wide than I remember and a little more stiff than I remember). The shoes are long enough so the ""somewhat small"" rating pertains to the slightly narrower width. As time goes on and they stretch out more, I'm sure they will get more comfortable, as with most shoes. I am mostly pleased with them, so thanks!

A review indicated that these Puma sneakers were fake and not authentic. I can't tell other than they were sold and shipped by Amazon so i'm going to say they are real. They were made in Cambodia.These Puma sneakers as I purchased two pairs for a great price look and fit great. Since I have flat feet, I can't wear shoes with arch support or i'm in a lot of pain so it's either Puma's or Converse All-Stars for me.

These are a beautiful dark blue.

These are great looking shoes and I do like them, just can't wear them if I'm going to be spending the whole day walking somewhere. I wouldn't wear them to a city where I'll be on my feet all day or someplace like Disney. The right shoe tends to squash my smallest toe uncomfortably when walking more than a couple of hours. By the end of a long day of walking my feet are done. That has never happened to me with any other shoe. Weird. Other than that they seem to hold up a little better than other shoes I've had. Certainly last longer than the Vans I had (and paid much more for). Maybe when it's time for another pair I'll get one size bigger, it's just that size-wise they seem perfect, just one narrows much more at the toes. I have plenty of other shoes where that doesn't happen so these stay in the rotation for light footwork days.

These were an Amazon Marketplace purchase and the seller did a great job.

I wish every business was that conscientious. As for the shoes they are great. I wear a 9D and they fit spot on. I got the gray because gray goes with everything. You can dress these bad boys down with say jeans and a T, or dress them up with some nice Chinos and Oxford button up. Doesn't matter.

Not a bad pair of shoes. The shoes are still wearable 1 year later. The 1 major issue I found was that the inner sole is slightly smaller then the entire shoe meaning if you wear these without socks; the edge of the sole will dig into your foot. With socks, it’s not a major issue.

Too tight as I wear a multiple E width so I knew what I was getting into.  Called the company and they said they do not offer  a wider shoe in this model.

I ordered a pair in ponderosa pine greenish color. Arrived two days after placing order. That was quick. I really love the old school look. I do not like those modern styled expensive sneakers. This pair is so comfortable to wear any day. Easy to pair with a lot of pants and shorts. I love the color green so i got me a deep shade of green like this pine colored pair. I also have a pair in black/white and a grayish one with electric green swoosh or whatever you call those things on the side of the shoe. Awesome to pair with my gray sweat pants and jacket with electric green logos. Satisfied with this purchase.

I bought these primary for their appearance, but I must admit that I was hoping that they'd have more cushioning and better arch support than they do. I was hoping they'd feel more like a running shoe, than Converse All Stars or Vans (which I have and love wearing ... for short stints). I normally wear a size US 10D Mens and that's what I ordered and they fit very well ... however, I may try ordering a pair a 1/2 size larger and get some decent inserts to make them a bit more comfortable. Not sure inserts would actually fit in this pair.

Was in the mood to get some new sneakers and the Puma Suede's were a great choice. Look wise, they look a lot better when worn than the what the pictures show; appearance of the shoes gets a two thumbs up from me. In terms of comfort, I can wear these all day without any discomfort and it feels nice to walk around thanks to the shoe's foundation. I did get them a half a size bigger than my actual shoe size but it still fits quite comfortably when tighten. The shoes take quite a bit of damage, without ruining the look of the shoe. No mud gets stuck to the bottom of it either, which I definitely liked. Recommended to anyone looking for a nice pair of sneakers anytime soon.

I'm back collecting Pumas again! This particular style of Puma shoes fit my feet really well. A little bit slightly more than medium with I would say.

I have worn a size 10 D (M) for many years, which is what I ordered when I bought these shoes. The first time I wore them, I did three miles at a brisk pace on the treadmill, which I do regularly. The shoes felt like they were really squeezing my feet, width wise, and when I took them off, I had mild blisters on both heels and my feet were both swollen. I am trying to wear them for short periods to get them broken in, but they still seem too narrow. In retrospect, I should have gone up a size in width.

I basically just wear these as a walking around shoe.  I really like the color (collegiate burgundy and white).

From a fashion perspective, they look good and serve as a nice alternate to casual Friday/jeans day.I normally wear a 12 wide and sized up to a 12.5 like others have suggested. I should have bought the 12 instead. It's not like going a half size longer bought me more width. The suede hugs my feet and makes my feet look like plump sausages about to bust through the casing. And now I've got too much extra room in the toe box.I have worn these shoes at work on a casual Friday and to the airport when traveling. I find that after about 4 hours of some light walking, I feel like another 4 hours of light walking/activity and I may be in for some blisters. They are not very comfortable for long durations and I don't know if that's a function of the flat soles, the longer shoe length or the tight width or a combination of all three.

Based on my past knowledge of Puma (and a rival brand too), I based my choice of size on the assumption that I should go a half size higher than normal. Consequently these were a perfect fit. However, I would advise anyone who is not sure of their own ideal fit that these sneakers are not a particularly wide fit and when ordering online, you will find out there is no option for alternate widths. I take a D width and they feel very good on width. if they stretch out after a few wearings I'll up-date.

They look and feel so great I am a 9.5 shoe and these are spot on... the light blue color is perfect.  the only small gripe I do have is that the white stripe along the sides of the puma's classic sneaker is that somewhat of off-white in color to it, I wish it was more of a true bright white so that it would blend in better with the rubber sole of the sneaker!!  that's my 2 cents

The style itself is tight. The shoes arrived sooner than expected though, I’m pleased with that. The shoe fits alittle to tight around the toe area. I have a normal size foot for the most part. I’m 5’6, athletic build, 148Ib. Size 8 in men. Us size. I have a normal arch in my foot and slender feet. I wouldn’t recommend using to walk long periods in. Nothing like fairs, festivals, amusement parks etc.

I saw a bunch of reviews claiming they received counterfeits. I'm no expert but the pair I ordered seemed to be genuine. If they are knock offs they're convincing enough for.My main gripe is that they're a little tight. I even ordered a size up from my usual and my toes still feel crammed up against the tip of the shoe. The sole is pretty rigid so I don't know that I'll do a lot of walking around in them. Probably just wear them to the office on Fridays.They look great though!

today is 11/25/17 1:24pm have recieved tennis shoes and they look great and more importantly fit good. I had some apprehensions about buying shoes without trying them on first. I wear a size 10 and purchased a 10 and they fit true to size I could not find this tennis shoe at any of the brick and mortar stores from one side of town to the other I almost gave up.The cost was excellent in comparison to similar models by the same maker. I would take the chance again. Great buy.

I bought the red with the white stripes pair for the premiere of the Sonic the Hedgehog movie though it would of been nice if they came pre-scotch guarded. Not a big issue for me though as I had a couple cans laying around from another pair of suede kicks I had previously purchased.

They look great and arrived really fast!Fit is just as expected, I wear 10.5 and have a wider foot - had no issues. Build quality is nice, no ""Glue Glitches"" or other defects.One thing, the part that touch the back of the ankle is raised as this is the shoe design and might irritate a bit as it rubs against the ankle.

there are a lot of reviews thinking these are fakes because of the ""YCM""' sticker on the inside of the box and chinese writing, but they are not.  I bought a pair of the blue suede at a local Puma shop and they had the same tag on the box.  Puma must have factory in China.  These are decent classic Puma suedes at the exact same price as the PUMA store.

Definitely a great shoe. It looks just like it does in the picture and it looks great in real life. The only problem I have with it is that the sole on the left shoe was not fit in very well so I can feel a crease in it which bugs my foot. However other than that I think it is a great shoe, especially for the price.

UPDATE: Before I started buying Pumas  I had inherited an old pair of Pumas that belonged to my father who has since pasted away. I know he had owned them for a long time. They are a half size smaller than what I buy, but I can still wear them. The soles are much more durable than today’s Pumas and only the upper edges around the ankles are wearing out. The last three pairs that I’ve ordered the soles have worn out long before the upper or rest of the shoe. (see photo, hole ). The soles just aren’t what they use to be. Three strikes and you’re out, I’m going to try a different brand of shoes.  ......................................................................................................................................................................................................  I suffer from Plantar Fascia and have learned from a Doctor that the athletic shoes that I have been wearing are to stiff and over supportive for my needs(I do not run or jog) and that I need a shoe that gives more and allows the foot to flex some(after all your foot is designed to flex and move, not be as stiff as a board). I got a used pair of these from my father and liked them so much I ordered a new pair. They are now the casual shoe of my choice.
"

Great shoe
"

There are no surprises here.  Color, fit, size was all exactly what I expected to get.  The arch is a little weird in these, but they're suede...it's not like they're meant for basketball or running.  It's not weird enough to keep it from becoming my goto casual Friday shoe.  I wear a 10 in most shoe brands, and this was a PERFECT fit in terms of length and toe space.
"
25524,"
Shoe looks good as expected.  Has retro-style.  Problem is sole/support is also retro.  And since shoe fits as expected I can't add an aftermarket cushion sole - would then be to tight.  Lesson learned, but dissatisfaction has to do with me, not Amazon or manufacturer.
"
25525,"
I ordered two pairs, one my usual size and the other next size larger. Glad I did because the show in my usual size was slightly tighter and uncomfortable, but the larger size was a better fit. Btw Amazon wardrobe is awesome— if you haven’t tried it yet, give it a go. Let’s you order stuff **without charging your card** for 7 days and only pay for what you keep. Been buying lots of clothes that way now.

I LOVE THESE SHOES!!They are completely worth the price. I've had this pair for about 2 months and I've walked in the rain, through mud and slush and after washing them off, they were as good as new. Somehow they didn't even smell, even though I had to dry them in my room as I live in the dorm.I would recommend these shoes to anyone who wants a pair to wear throughout the day.(Although I will say that I'm not sure these shoes will last long if worn in the gym but to each his own)
"
25527,"
I found that the shoes are extremely comfortable. The color is nice and vibrant. Really enjoyed wearing them. I have only worn them once so I can't comment on the durability of the shoes. They seemed well made but the suede is pretty soft and I was concerned that it might break over time. I do recommend these shoes, though.
"
25528,"
I love the bright red color and the comfort of the shoes; however, the extra white laces provided are extremely wide which is not my cup of tea. Another point to take note of is that the suede is difficult to keep clean without using proper suede maintenance products. The outsole is nice and sturdy, but my pair were eventually worn down to the point where a hole emerged around the ball of my foot. Overall, I would recommend these be worn as casual sneakers for anyone who isn't planning on anything too athletic, and wants a bright colored, comfortable shoe.

I have heard from a few people that Puma runs small, so I decided to size up. I am usually a women's 7 and wear a women's 7/men's 5 in converse, so i decided to size up to 7.5 women. However, puma's women to men conversion is a bit different, with 7.5 women equal to 6 in men, not a 5.5 like converse would be. So the shoes turned out a tad big. i should have sized up a half size in respect to men's sizes (from 5 to 5.5) instead.other than that, the quality is nice and since i usually have wide feet, buying a men's shoe helped and the sides did not feel tight.
"
25530,"
The shoes were a gift and fit well in his normal size. They are a good looking classic shoe, but the suede does get a bit fuzzy looking after a few wears. One of the colored laces got super shredded and fuzzy when it untied and he didn't immediately re-tie it, but that's not the fault of the shoes, because most people don't walk around with untied laces for an extended period of time lol! I guess the condition of the suede after a few wears could also be from rough use by the wearer also! Great shoe altogether.

Great shoe.  I've had a ton of compliments on them.  I got a great deal on them ($45). The very next day the cheapest pair was $65.Would've given 5 stars,  but these shoes didn't improve my skateboarding ability,  my vertical jump,  nor give me superhuman running speed.  Guess I'll keep trying new shoes until I die in search of the magic ones...

These were nice-looking shoes, but they were about a size narrower than advertised.  I wear a 9D (US), and these seemed to be a 9C.  I wore my pair a handful of times.  After a few wears, they hurt my feet, and I had to donate them.

glad i can still find these shoes after so many years! four stars only because of the lack of GREAT arch support but i can still wear them all day. puma's have always run on the narrow side so i knew what i was buying and after some wear they do give some. recommend this shoe to anyone looking for a blast from the past or someone looking for something new. just BE AWARE all puma's run on the narrow side!

I wear a size 12 and ordered the size 12 D and they fit perfectly. They are very comfortable.

I have the real original puma Clydes and had to wear 1/2 size larger than normal. Puma stated that the current sizes are the same but they are larger than the Clydes, but not enough to make huge difference. The suede isn't as nice and the stripe should be white not a whiteish beige. The choice of laces is a nice option. The tread is the same as the original, so it is a royal pain to clean if you step in dog poop.

Order arrived on time and in good condition. I love these sneakers. However, just as other people have posted, they are quite a narrow sneaker and a little small. I usually wear a US 10 so this is what I ordered. However, they were just a teeny, tiny bit small. I tried them on and wore them around the house for a couple of hrs (so I could still return them if need be) and they were ever so slightly pinching my toes. Whatever size you typically wear get either 0.5 or 1 size bigger.

I bought these ina 10.5D and they feel a little narrow. It could be that at 46 years old my feet have gotten wider (not sure if that's a thing) but they do feel a little tight on the sides. Other than that fit is good and I love the way they look.

These Puma sneakers are nice looking and good for walking.  They do not have much arch support or cushioning in the sole so you really can only wear them on flat terrain.  My feet hurt after several hours in them.

I purchased these shoes for my husband, he chose the color. They arrived within the specified time and were exactly as described. They have two sets of laces and they were comfortable enough to wear right away without too much breaking in.

After daily wear since arrival, they are a little scruffed but all the stitching and material is still intact.

These were for my 10 year old son. He is a Sz 7.  The 7's were too tight/narrow so we returned them and ordered the 7.5, which fit him comfortably. Really nice shoe.

This is probably the 3rd pair of these shoes I have bought over the years. They are slightly narrow! Keep that in mind if you have wide feet. I ideally wear a 13 4E, but size 14 works well (though still a tiny bit narrow). They look nice and they are comfortable. I do wish the white decals on the sides were as white as the soles, but perhaps that's an issue with leather vs rubber.Highly recommend! Thank you PUMA for supporting us bigfoots.

Bought these on sale on prime day. I have a pretty serious shoe collection, mostly dress shoes. I wanted to add some sneakers to my rotation and suade seemed like it would appeal to me more than most sneakers. I love the color. They are super comfortable. They look great. I have only worn them twice and I have had numerous people compliment me on them both times. They come with two pair of laces one green and one blue. Changing laces really changes the look of the shoes and is a nice touch.

When I was about 15 years old, these were the ""must have"" shoes (I'm 54 now). As soon as I saw these I jumped on them. Still comfortable and cool, just like in the 70s. One of my customers manages a chain athletic shoe store and says they are selling tons of these shoes. My GF saw them and asked me to order a pair for her. I was concerned that the quality would not be very good considering the low price, but I was pleasantly surprised. You just can't beat these Pumas. At about $50.00 they are a steal.

Love, Love, Love. these shoes. I have this same shoe in at least 5 different colors. I have been buying Puma Suede Classics for twenty plus years now, by far my favorite shoe style. I wear a mens size 13. my feet are a little on the wide side, and I have always found puma's to fit well. these shoes don't offer much arch support, so there not great for running, or wearing on long walks, but you cant beat the style and comfort for hanging around at a back yard BBQ with your boys. I will continue buying these as long as puma keeps making them.

Bought these specifically to go to away Mets games.  There seems to be a trend these days of having the laces be woven a certain way, and I didn't change them the first day.

was ready to order them in colors but fit is bad, too narrow at ball of foot and a little long. tongue and heel have vinyl(?) stitched to inside. seemed ok when i tried on for a minute but walking around block was different story. even gave away that size and order up another half size and laced loose, still same problem. Vinyl ridge of tongue and its stitching fight the ball of my foot for already snug space. have to wear sock tall enough to cover ankle as top edge of vinyl tongue also digs into ankle and creates red mark. can only wear a few hours. oh well, keep looking for retros that actually fit.

I just received these shoes, so this is a very superficial review at this point. They look great, fit well, are comfortable, and seem to be well constructed. My experience with the Puma brand is that they tend to run maybe a half size small and somewhat narrow, and since I wear a 12 and size 12.5 is not available, I tried a 13. They fit perfectly with an additional insole & orthotics. So far I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend these shoes.

Aesthetically my favorite pair of shoes ever. These Puma Suede sneakers really are classics and have a timeless feel to them. However; I am having a problem with the tongue. It keeps sliding inwards. I've laced through the loop mid-way on the tongue as well as through the label tag. This helps but it still refuses to stay snug.Again these shoes look awesome and it would be a shame if you can't wear them for long periods without irritation.
"

I normally wear 12. I read all of the reviews in advance and they said that the Pumas run narrow. This allowed me to order a size larger to allow for a tiny bit more width. Great looking shoe, the little bit of extra length is a minor distraction as I don't intend to use a red suede low top sneaker for any actual physical exertion... just to look sporty. I have Asic Gel and New Balance for actual sports wear. :)

Puma is my signature sneaker and I can't get enough of them so I've owned quite a few pairs and the sizing is really hard to get right. They are often too small even if you go a half or full size bigger. Even the same sized shoe and style may be cut narrower or wider than the last pair. Possibly based on where they are manufactured. Still I love the style and the comfort, wish they were easier to find in all the cool colors.

I have been looking around for a sneaker of this style and color and finally found these. Now I already like puma's so this was an easy buy for me but I can tell you that they look great, very stylish without being flashy and that is what I go for.

Well worth the price for a stylish, well made and comfortable sneaker.

I love these.  I've never worn Pumas before.  I'm >50 and  grew up a Converse kid and then converted to Nike.  These are just great casual shoes.  I ordered 1/2 size larger than normal because these seem just a little tight and I don't have wide feet.  I normally wear a 10M and I ordered the 10.5 and I'm quite happy.  As a matter of fact, I've added two more pair of different colors to my cart.

Like the look and feel but... but the Cabernet color bled onto the white swoosh within 3 hours of first putting them on.  The burgundy color also bled on to my white laces, so I went back to the red so it wouldn't be noticeable.  I fought with myself about lower this to 3 starts but they are way too comfortable and the still look good.  I will probably buy another color soon because after all they are cheap enough to own more than one pair.

I hadn’t bought shoes in way too long and immediately fell in love with these. They’re comfortable, tidy and modest.

I used to love these shoes but as time goes on they keep making them with cheaper materials.  The soles on these shoes have worm through with multiple holes after only a few months of, let's say, every-other-day wear.  They used to make the shoes with leather inners but now they are made with a cheap fabric.  It has resulted in holes near my ankles and now cause pain to my feet when i wear them.This will unfortunately be the last time i buy these shoes from Puma.  Shame on them for ruining a once great shoe.  I have a pair I bought years ago that has the higher quality materials and are still in my rotation of shoes I wear.  These shoes have unfortunately gone the way of may once-great brands.

I can usually fit into 10.5 or 11, but 11 in this style was just too large.  Having said that, they looked great!  I've returned for 10.5.  Ironically, I also ordered another pair of pumas (different style-canvas) in a 10.5.  Wore them today and they are a bit too snug.  Go figure.

Fine shoes, however, I always wear 10.5 and ordered a 10.5, only to discover that they were a slightly bit lengthy than expected. With socks on, it is not a problem.

This is my second pair of these shoes and I fully expect this to be the only kind of shoes (of this type) that I will ever buy again. I normally wear a size 10D,  so that is what I ordered the first time, but I had to return them for replacement with a 10.5D so at least in my case, they run a half size smaller than the shoes I normally wear.

Based on reviews I decided to buy these shoes a size larger (10.5) than my normal size (10)but it turned out to be big for my feet.

I love the looks of these shoes.  They look much like the first pair of leather tennies I ever wore ... back in 1973-74.  Comfortable, nice looking and go well with the spirit wear for a local high school team I back.  The shoes are light weight and I don't consider them ""athletic"" shoes, just casual footwear.  When I walk long distances or stand on my feet a lot I either opt for sturdier shoes or put orthotic inserts in these.
"
25582,"
I almost always use insoles with my shoes, so I never actually wore them with the insoles they came with.  I use a SOLE Softec Response insole, and it makes this pair of PUMAs extremely comfortable.  They are a very durable pair of shoes that don't show a lot of wear.  The only problem that I'm starting to run into is wearing these shoes too much--almost to the point of wearing through the sole of the shoe (which is only a compliment to the product).

Fits well and looks good. However, suede fabric is fairly thin and needs to have a thicker/softer feel to it. Prices of different color options vary widely and needs to be more uniform.

These are pretty great shoes. They fit really well, but look really large on my feet. Probably because of the large white bottom. I have pretty big feet so they're not perfect for me. They are really comfortable though and look good. I just wish my feet weren't like skis for skiing.

It makes no sense. I have a pair of pumas and I was planning on moving to a new city and while my old ones are in good shape after YEARS, I thought I should get a new, shiny pair. In fact, when they arrived, I didn't wear them. Then I got busy and ended up not trying them on for a few months. Then I realized I should break them in. I have been wearing them for a little over a month almost every day. I started getting blisters on the back of my feet. So I put on band-aids assuming they just needed a little time. Then I tried baby powder thinking the smooth back might be rubbing against the back of my feet. Then I started wearing two pairs of socks, one of which is longer to cover more skin. I now have a blood stain on the back, blisters that keep opening, and I can't return them. I just don't get it. I generally wear my sneakers every day and it's just so disappointing, not to mentoin painful. I know I can't return them but I just wanted you to know. Maybe they changed the back of them, but they are killing me. Now I have a new pair and I have to go back to my old shoes (which I have had over two years and are still fantastic.)

Son needed a pair of everyday shoes and this is what he chose.  He loves these shoes!  They actually replaced a three year old similar pair by Puma.  You can't go wrong with leather shoes that last three years.  Do not hesitate to purchase.If you find my review helpful, please indicate so by using the voting buttons.

Just like the sneaker of my youth. A cute throw back casual shoe. I have a slightly wider foot; these are very comfortable. Happy with purchase. I have owned them for approximately 2.5 months - no Issues and color is still vibrant.

After reading reviews online about running narrow, I found them to fit true to size. I actually could have bought a size 11 (I am a size 11 1/2 narrow).  That is the problem with buying shoes online--you have to try them on.  It is still morning and feet tend to swell during the day, so I will keep them and maybe put another insole in to firm them up.

I accidentally purchased 2 of the SAME COLOR . These are like the classic ones I grew up with back in 1983 Classic and brings back fond memories of growing up in Long Island NY. I'm curious if I can exchange the other one for a different color. Inbox me to let me know.

Runs slightly small. Had to order a half size up, Thankfully I tested em out in DSW before ordering on amazon. Great price, if you can get them around 30 or below. Decent quality, Second pair of laces are laughably large and beefy. Will buy another pair at the same price in the future but in a different color scheme.

These are my favorite shoes.  I'm a shoe guy, I have about 30 pairs.  I just got my second pair of these in a different color and I don't think I will buy a different kind of tennis shoe, I'll just buy these in different colors.  They have about every color combo you could want.  They're warm enough to wear them in winter, and cool enough to wear them in summer.  They look good in pants and in shorts.  The perfect sneaker.
"
25607,"
I pretty much knew that these shoes would fit well and I got them in the gray and another pair in blue at amazing prices so they were worth it. So far they've been very durable, they look great, and they are very comfortable without me having to adjust the laces much and I'm happy with these shoes.
"

I purchased the item on sale for $19 shipped.  Pumas always are a step smaller then US size shoes.  So order a half size bigger.  Since this product is suede I made sure to use leather protector on it before wearing.  Not a lot of arch support for people with those issues.
"
25609,"
Great shoes and pretty much exactly what I expected, The yellow was a little darker (orangish than I thought from the online pics, but that's not a problem for me). I had a pair many years ago, so I already knew that the arch support wasn't terrific, but very stylish shoes and I really like them

I bought these because I couldn't find my favorite Speedcats anywhere (are they discontinued?) - I also bought some Ecco sneakers at the same time and have to admit when trying on one of each shoe they Ecco shoes are way more comfortable support-wise BUT for what these are (I mean, I'm not running a marathon here) they're perfect.  Love the colour (hard to find women's sneakers that don't have pink or purple on them) and how they look.  Size felt accurate.
"
25613,"
First, Puma's come a half size smaller than what you would typically wear in the U.S. I learned this after purchasing two separate pairs of Puma shoes. So order them a half size bigger.Second, these are super nice looking shoes with a good selection of color. The support is not that great, but man do they look cool... and that is the most important thing. Glad I bought them.
"

Been wearing Puma for many years. Historically leaned more toward the California and GV Special shoes with a little beefier sole profile. The Classic+ sole is a little more uniform in terms of detailing and height variance. Comes with two lace options, which is always nice. I'm a little more drawn to the red laces in terms of color, but--interestingly--its a fat lace. And once I had the red threaded into place felt like it was a little too much. The blue is a more subdued, typical-sized option that still looks terrific with the shoe and makes the Puma stripe carry the flash.

So far I really like these shoes. My first pair of Pumas and so far so good. They were a bit snug in spots for the first few wearings, but they stretch out nicely. They look great and I get tons of compliments on them. Great quality too. I would recommend these shoes.

These classic Pumas are as advertised. The color is refreshing and the fit is just right. They take me back to my earlier days of sporting the classic shoe. They turn heads when I am wearing them. If you're an old school suede Puma head, then these are the sneakers for you!

I wanted to provide an answer for a question I myself had concerning fit. For those that often wear Nike you know that Nike runs small. If you wear an 11 in most shoes you will need a 12 in a pair of Nikes. For those considering purchasing these shoes know that Puma runs true to size. If you wear an 11 in most shoes, an 11 in Puma is going to fit perfectly as these shoes have for me.

This model of puma is my favorite among sneakers. I almost exclusively wear this model and keep buying them as they wear down. And that is wear the problem is. The bottom wear too quickly. Luckily the sneaker is cheap enough that I keep buying them. But I hope Puma would take care of that.

Love these shoes; they are so comfortable and the price on here is a steal. I use them for skateboarding and keep a pair for casual wear. Got one pair in red/white, another blue/white, and black/white coming in tomorrow. They fit true to size. If you have doubts, go to a local store and try them on. At first they can be a little tight but after some walking around they break in and feel amazing.
"

I LIKE THESE SHOES.  I DON'T HOWEVER UNDERSTAND WHY THERE IS A $20 DIFFERENCE ON THE SAME SHOE BETWEEN DIFFERENT COLORS.  $39 FOR A PAIR OF PUMAS IS AN OKAY DEAL.  $65 IS A RIP OFF.  SO I GOT THIS COLOR BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONLY ONES I COULD AFFORD.
"
25626,"
I am a size 11 1/2 - 12. I was concerned about getting an 11 1/2 size because its hit and miss. These shoes fit well. I was suprised and expected them to fit tight. They are perfect. I treated rhem with waterproofer as soon as I got them to help combat the bleeding problems and it darkened the color just a bit which I am happy with. I ordered blue, they are sweet.

I was a poor kid in high school (1970s) and had to wear canvas Converse All-Stars - which were good but not as cool as the leather suede Puma Clydes that the truly cool kids wore. Now that I'm richer than all of those cool kids, I can wear whatever I want and I have found the Puma Suedes to be most comfortable and retro stylish. On the plus side, they match my Ford Mustang GT - something else I couldn't afford when I was a poor high school student in the 70s.
"

Bought a pair last year and assumed these would be the same. But my first pair had more padding inside and could walk for miles on them.Either Puma is making them cheaper or they offer another shoe very similar to this that is more comfortable.

Bought these for my fiancé and they are perfect. Not only do they look amazing but they are also very comfortable I love that the white on the bottoms and extra white fat laces are so stark white (if you get the black on black) can't ever go wrong with classic suede and this style says Yes, I have a sick shoe game but I'm not a little boy anymore lol ladies I'm sure you understand what I mean. Love them. Thank you!!!
"
25637,"
I like these shoes a lot, but what I didn't take into account was how noticeable dirt and water stains would be on such a light gray. It's not that big a deal though, I just bought some suede cleaner and proofer, and they are better now. I would recommend proofing them as soon as you get them and clean them reasonably soon after they get dirty, because the cleaning method with a brush sort of ruined the suede just a tad after the dirt and such had been left on for an extended period of a few days to a week.
"
25638,"
The fit is perfect, colors are vibrant, and just an all around great shoe. These are my third pair and I'll buy another when I burn through these. I am a chef and spend a ton of time on my feet so I do use inserts with them, but there is plenty of room for those...some of the most comfortable shoes for barking dogs!

Little larger than I thought they would be. I bought a pair of size 9 Puma Liga's and they fit like a champ. These in a size 9 however and I'm swimming in them a little bit.

They fit well.  They look good and feel good.  They are comfortable with no break in.  If for some reason the sizing was off, Amazon would replace them with no fee or shipping charges.

These look great and fit comfortably, but they shouldn't be confused with athletic shoes. They're comfortable enough for walking around and general wear, but don't offer much in the way of support. I must say that these are the first shoes I've ever worn that have garnered compliments from strangers. Buy them for their classic, understated stylishness and just get a pair of running shoes for the track.

I didn't realize it when I first tried them on, but after a day or two my big toe felt a bit sore. Normally a 10.5 in Puma suede fits me perfectly. They're  running a bit smaller then usual. Other then that they'd be five stars.

Purchased for my husband as a welcome home gift. He loves them. He's rough on shoes and I often try to go cheap with shoes. I sprung for Pumas and I think it's the first of many purchases of shoes for him. They are sturdy shoes and good quality.

This is my second pair and I love these shoes. They look great, are comfortable for walking around all day (don't mistake them for an actual athletic show, though) and hold up well. Only replacing my other pair because the suede fades after about a year and they're near impossible to clean. Note that these shoes definitely run small. I usually wear a 9.5 or 10 in other brands, but need a 10.5 for these Pumas.

Perhaps I'm simply buying the wrong type of shoe and I was never the intended foot for this shoe.1. This shoe is slippery. Any occasion that I've encountered a moderately smooth surface or any wetness at all has met with traction issues. I live in the Pacific Northwest and deal with a ton of rain - I didn't expect the shoe to have such dismal levels of grip. I've already fallen on my arse twice now wearing these. I couldn't tell you the last time I had that happen. Why wear a shoe if it isn't going to give you traction? Why would somebody design a shoe with such terrible grip?2. Even with arch supports put in this shoe is relatively uncomfortable. I wouldn't recommend it for anybody who puts a lot of pressure on their feet. I've tried to wear them in and take a few longer walks in them and every time I'm met with misery. Wearing these shoes makes me not want to move.Long story short, I've clearly made a mistake in purchasing these shoes. I like how they look, but it ends there - even so, the plastic lower section isn't exactly the pinnacle of fashion.Why did I do this to myself? If you expect any work out of your shoes - I wouldn't buy these.

I've always been a huge Puma Suede fan, and when I saw it on sale, I just had to grab it. No regrets.As a rule of thumb for suede, I always go for half a size big cause they're nice thick and cozy. I'm a 27cm US 8.5 and I bought a 9 and the extra toe space makes it so much more comfortable to wear.

Good PUMA shoe. I would just like to make sure it's understood that the classic 'swish' on these shoes are not white.At least not as white as the sole or the ties. I'd call it a flesh color almost. Still satisfied. Nice shoe!These are Suede Classic Sneaker, High Risk Red/White

Despite purchasing these from Amazon directly (the ships from and sold by Amazon tag was clearly visible) I received a fake pair similar to another recent reviewer. They didn't feel right at all; almost felt like wearing a cheap 20 dollar pair of chuck taylors (felt like the only thing between your feet and the ground was a thin layer of canvas). After researching, sure enough these aren't genuine Puma's. I also compared what they SHOULD look like on Puma's site, and the fabric behind the tongue, and on the heel is totally wrong (should be a mesh fabric, and instead it's a vinyl type feeling material..) They were VERY stiff and uncomfortable. I'm really upset that even though I purchased from Amazon directly, I still received a counterfeit product. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning them and waiting for a credit. I don't believe i'll be purchasing shoes on amazon any longer based on this horrible experience! The previous reviewer was correct, there is a sticker on the inside of the box that says ""YCM PRODUCTS"", which is a chinese manufacturer...that's the dead give-away that these are fake fake fakeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have never been a fan of these style of shoes, but have heard they are comfortable so gave them a shot.  I have to say, these are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned.

The shoes look good, but they are a little tight, but that should be fine once they're broke in.  I don't care for the wide shoe laces, and the suede's dye has stained the shoe laces already (I've only had them for 3 days now).  Other than that, I think they'll be fine and comfy.  If these last a few months without problems, I may get another pair in another color.

These are a great every-day shoe. I got them for my ""casual"" days at work and got complements on the very first day wearing them.

These are a very nice pair of sneakers from Puma. Since they are Suede, I thought they might degrade if i get them wet. Which did happen, but give them enough time to dry and they will retain their original look. Laces are too long so I invested in a pair of short laces. Other than that, they have been working really good for me. I wear them almost the whole day in college and they certainly are comfortable for long use.

There are are few luxuries on this planet that can compare to good-looking, comfortable, long-lasting shoes.  After having had these shoes for about half a year, my only true gripe is that the suede collects a lot of dirt and the shoes, while still wicked comfortable, are increasingly less and less presentable.  But maybe that's what a shoe is supposed to be -- protection from the dirt.  Either way, I'd go back and repeat the process again if I had to.

Got them today, great fit. Feels good, lots of cushion. Although I thought they came with an extra pair of laces. While it’s not a problem I’m not a fan of the fat laces.
"
25702,"
My 3rd pair of these shoes. The color combo (grey with white stripes) goes with pretty much everything and looks quite good. When I buy new denim, the suede stains easily, but not the fault of the shoe really. New denim often bleeds color for a bit. They break in quickly and are quite comfy.

The only thing im disappointed about in these shoes is on the picture in the description they appear to be of a lighter shade (baby blue) of blue than the ones i actually received.  Mine are almost a royal blue.. Not that dark but almost.  I can only presume the lighting in the photo made me assume i was getting a slightly different color...Quite disappointing 😔😔😔

Puma.  Love it.  This blue is EXACTLY what I wanted...true to picture (but prettier in person).  They come with fat white laces as well as the blue ones.  The puma mark is cream.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  They fit as expected...I wear a 9 women, so ordered a 7.5 men... most of them on amazon are marked as both...if not, order 1 1/2 sizes down to get a women's size and with Puma that normally works.  These are good quality. I want more LOL

Always loved Puma as a kid to play basketball in.  Saw these and thought the price was rally good. They arrived within 3 days.  At first wasn't so sure about the color scheme - comes with both black laces and white laces - ended up opting for the white and loved the look.  Took these to Florida to visit my Dad - he is a walker and I walk with him.  Walked close to 5 miles a day in these and barely knew I had anything on my feet.  Really comfortable.

I haven't owned PUMAs in years.  I missed them and Love owning them!  But my feet are wider now and these shoes are definitely not for the wide of foot - everything fits fine except in the toes - they are just a tiny bit too narrow.  If you have really wide feet I would find somewhere to try these on before ordering.

These are the like a super hot chick of shoes, they look fantastic, slick and sexy.  When you first but them on its like yeah I could wear these for life but after a few hours with them you can't wait to get home and take them off and leave them in a different room.Seems all the shoe manufactures have gone to these thin narrow shoes that look almost like boat shoes.  I can't find anything like the old Van's from the 90's with the fat tongue, those where super comfortable.

I have flat feet and spend all day standing on my feet at work. I can wear these easily and don't have to worry about having sore feet. They look great really nice and bright.

Purchased as a gift for my son. I'm not sure of the authenticity as others have complained since this is the first pair of Puma's I've purchased. I was pleasantly surprised to find them in my son's size, 14. He saves them for special occasions and loves his new shoes.

Very cute color and material. Versatile to wear during any season (except snow of course) and it fits well and isnt too tight which is a plus especially since I have fat feet. I didnt give it five stars because I havent walked all day in it yet so will post about full day comfortability later

I couldn't tell from the pictures what color the accent was (in some pictures it looked red, others it was orange-ish and other it was even pink-ish) - for your information, it's red. Overall, I'm happy with these shoes, but not sure yet how they will hold up.

I really like these Puma Suede Classic sneakers, but the sizing is definitely narrow. I wear a US size 9-1/2M or European size 43 Birkenstocks, Clarks, Sidi, BMW, Timberland, and other premium men's shoes. I'll exchange these size 10 for a 10-1/2

This is the classic Puma suede sneaker. Decent quality and fits as expected. I find these shoes are far more fashion than function.

Ever since LL Cool J rapped ""wearing light blue Pumas and a whole lotta gold"" these have been the top of the food chain of classic Pumas.

These are classic suede sneakers with no frills, no strange, aggressive tread, no bizarro color scheme.  They are from a time when there weren't a lot of specialized shoes for every single activity you can think of. One possible downside:  the cushioning inside is soft (nice!) but with little arch support (less nice).  They are thin and light.  I wouldn't run a 5K race in these,  but they are absolutely fantastic for casual wear and driving.

I got matching shoes for my husband and I (I know, so cheesy) and the are both GREAT! I got our usual sizes (6M and 9.5M) and they both fit us perfectly. The suede is good quality. I got the grey color and the color and detail are really nice. They come with semi-thin grey laces and thick white laces. For the price, you can't go wrong! Truly unisex. I want to buy more colors! Would make a great Christmas/anniversary/Valentines gift.

This is a fantastic looking shoe and really comfy as well. The midsole is soft enough without feeling squishy, so walking around all day in these feels great.

To start off, this is a comfortable,trendy, and stylish shoe. my personal experience may differ from yours. I have had the shoe 3 months ( bought in August 2017)of wear for every other day as my school, and hang out attire. Sadly today the” still has decent thickness” sole just split under my feet leaving me confused about the build quality of the shoe. I am at but of disappointment beacause 3 months was not what I expected these would last, especially for my light wear, I expected the good half of a year or two at the very least. And I’m stuck with the shoes on until I get home being as I’m at school.

Size runs true to size. Typically I am a 10.5 but I have had terrible luck in ordering shoes online. Usually the shoes I order are a half size too small.

My only complaint is that it did not come with white laces as a second option. I prefer to go with white lace shoes in black sneakers. I bought some white laces locally, but it would have been better if the product provided this option out of the box.

This is the fifth pair of Puma Suede Classics that I have ordered on Amazon (I have 5 different color schemes). These are completely consistent in terms of fit. The actual colors typically look much better than they appear in the iffy photos online. They are comfortable, if you know what to expect...obviously, do not expect cushiony running shoes.

A beautiful sneaker. They fit pretty well, though the heel support on the right sneaker is rigid and rubbed my ankle. After loosening the ankle support a few times, they feel fine. All in all I like them a lot.

My boyfriend is a size 11 and the size runs bigger. A 10.5 would of been perfect size. Keep in mind when ordering your size.

This is a very nice shoe. I always need to buy Puma shoes a size larger than I normally wear and these were no exception. They have held up very well in the few months I have been wearing them. I'm not sure I would wear them for anything more than a leisurely stroll though.
"
25847,"
Yes!!! They come with the fat, white laces...and they rock!  A true classic that never goes out of style.  I love these shoes so much that I ALWAYS make sure to have a decent pair on-hand.  They're a little snug for my size (13) but stretch out within a few days.  As long as Puma keeps making them, I will always buy them.

"

These are the first pair of Pumas that I've owned and I've found them to be great shoes. Very comfortable, though still not quite broken in after only 4 or 5 wears. With a firmer tongue than many similar style shoes, these Pumas have a premium feel relative to the inexpensive price.
"
25855,"
I had this pare a couple years back and loved them. Once you wear them in they are as comfortable as socks! The materials and craftsmanship is really good for a shoe that's around $50. I decided to rebuy them and I wasn't disappointed.  Fit's great. Even for having wide feet. If you too are like me just wait a week they should conform nicely to your foot :) I'll probably buy these again next year.

These are FAKE FAKE FAKE.  Counterfeit.  Knock-offs.Only one set of laces, and not the fat ones.  Real Puma Suede's come with white and dark laces.Gold stamping can be rubbed off and is blotchy compared to a sharp REAL Puma logo/ SUEDE/ Springing Puma on the heel.The suede blotches with exposure to water.  This has NEVER happened on any genuine Puma I've ever owned in the past 20 years.  The suede feels cheap, brittle and stiff.Not nearly as comfortable out-of-the-box as the genuine PUMAS.  Narrow feeling, pinch the pinky toe.I mean, they're shoes.  I can wear them and they look OK.  But if they last 1/4 as long as real PUMAs, I'll be shocked.  I've worn other Puma Suedes for 365+ days in a row without issue.  We'll see about these.Because of all of the above, I'll NEVER order shoes from Amazon again.

Love these shoes. It's been months and they're still holding together quite nicely. I'm one of ""those guys"" to have the same shoes until they're beat to pulp and then I move on to the next pair. Aside from that I'm not huge shoe guy, so all I can really say is that I like the style and that they are far from cheaply made.

I bought these because they were on sale and they looked pretty cool. I was very excited when I got them. I put them on and instantly noticed how uncomfortable they were. I made sure the laces were pretty loose and tried again, still uncomfortable. I will give them a little longer before I say they are awful but I remember Puma's being a lot more comfortable a decade ago.Also, I normally wear a 13 (US) but I had to buy 14 (US). Puma seems to make them a little small.
"
25876,"
I love the color and size of these.Two issues I have are both product defects that make me think these are factory rejects.1. Where the sole is glued on to the top-sole there is a line of darker purple that looks like it was where the sole was intended to be glued.2. On the left shoe, there is a sewing defect on the inside of the big toe where the seam is. There is a thick patch there that rubs a bit.
"

These are very stylish, however with all shoes (maybe just suede) the toes get indented and stay like that if you happen to leave something on them or someone steps on your toes. I don't really have any other issues with them.

Great shoes. I am a US size 9 but, after reading other reviews of the size being a bit off due to the shoe shape, I ordered a half size bigger, 9.5. These fit perfect and are comfortable. If you are skeptic about the size, order a half size larger and if you think they are too big, you can always return them for free and get your desired size.
"

What can I say.. They look amazing and this colour hands down is the best colour Puma has to offer in this style.  Get compliments on these all the time.  They fit me perfectly in length and width.  Very comfortable to wear and stylish.  I just ordered a burgandy pair that is how much I love these shoes..

Probably the best shoes I have owned in a while. Great fit, looks nice, and they aren't ""skater shoes"". I will note that after some time the white rubber around the shoe turning yellow and getting brittle; however, this is expected, since I have owned these shoes for over 2 years!

I ordered a half size bigger because all the reviews said they ran small. They fit OK but I'm very disappointed because all the reviews said  the sneakers come with colored and white laces. I really wanted the white laces but there were no white laces in the box with the sneakers. That's my biggest gripe!

A tad bit tight for true to size but I considered that they never been worn and needed to stretch just a little little bit. Otherwise perfect

They fit a little small, but they are wearable, and maybe will break in and stretch out a little. Nice looking sneakers, but one thing bugs me, the color is 'beetroot purple', but everyone says it looks like pink. I'm not a pink sneaker kind of guy. It's hard to get the perfect sneaker. Need a pair for the gym (Nikes), a pair for home (Pumas), a pair for the office (Vans). Every time I buy a pair, I want another.

So, there's not a lot to say about these shoes other than the fact that they're well made and they look great. They are a bit narrow, but as with most shoes, most discomfort goes away after you've worn them for a few days. They even came with a second set of laces, which is nice.

I've had these for a little over a year and wear them pretty regularly.  the sole of the shoe has cracked and torn in places, so if i step in a puddle my socks get wet.  They're comfortable, but i wish the rubber was a bit more flexible and didn't split.

i'm old enough to have worn the original suede pumas.  also wore them again when they brought them back in the early 90s.  this incarnation is not good.  even at the $25 i paid, i couldn't justify keeping them.  they seem like a cheaper version that would be made for an outlet store...the suede is thin, the tongue and collar are too padded and the sole is really soft and hollow.looking at the pics of puma's other reissues, these don't look like an isolated case.  the romas and ligas look bad too.  it's a shame that a company like puma feels the need to cut so many corners even at $50-60 retail.  not expecting heirloom quality here but i doubt these would last more than a few months.

I love these shoes. I ordered them in peacoat/white. My only concern with them was wearing them with darker bluejeans. Those concerns were quickly subdued when I slipped them on with a pair of dark skinny jeans. These shoes literally go with anything and they are super comfortable.

These shoes are classics! Still around from the 80's when break dancing ruled the streets. They even come with a pair of fat laces - so you can lace them up nice and loose and slip them of when you're doing windmills and back spins. Love these shoes~

This is my third pair of Puma Suede shoes, they are my absolute favorite shoe. They have a causal look and are super comfortable. They are built to last, each pair I buy lasts me at least 2 years. I would definitely recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a pair of comfy casual shoes.

The thing I would have liked to be different were the laces.  The shoes came with regular 'zinfandel' laces and fat gray laces.  I would have preferred the fat 'zinfandel' laces.  Other that, awesome shoes. Brings back memories.

Ordered mens US 10 and found the shoe roomy but a bit too loose so I opted for the US 9.5.  Felt snug and comfortable until after 4 hours then it got a little tight in the toe-box.  Probably a nice shoe for casual wear but nothing I'd want to wear walking around all-day in.  Nice looking shoe, should hold up pretty well.

Can't praise Puma's enough. I tried other competing brands that looked nice but was way too narrow and tight.  They also had no support which started screwing up my arch and calves.  Puma's look great and actually fit correctly with amazing support. Performance and looks.  What a concept. Never going back to those ""fashion brands"" again.

It's all about the stitching of the sole. I never  buy glued soles. The quality of puma shows.

I've only worn them twice and so far really like them.  The color is exactly what I wanted and they are very comfortable.  My only complaint is they're slightly narrow, but I know the will stretch.
"
26085,"
These shoes look really good and they even feel good ... at first.  After wearing them for a couple hours I could feel blisters forming on my feet.  The lining around the opening of the shoe is really to prevent your foot from slipping, but if these shoes don't fit just right then you can expect them to slowly rub you raw or give you blisters wherever that lining sits on your feet.  Luckily I bought these with weight lifting in mind as they have a good flat sole, but I can't wear them for longer than about an hour at a time without starting to feel some pain.

The photos make these look like a deep red color. They are not. The color is more like a pinkish red, closer to salmon than cherry. Anyway, these were replacements for an older pair of Puma Suedes. The old ones have leather trim on the upper part of the lining, also the tongue, and the footbed is very firm. These are none of those things: cloth everywhere, and the footbed feels like... Vans. Ugh.

Any brand i have ever bought has not held up for more than a year. Pumas will last you as long as 2.5  years as my last pair did. these ones get very comfortable when you break them in and look good. I wear them to work, school, and anywhere else i end up. Great shoe for the price.

I read other reviews before ordering and ordered a half size larger. I'm barely a 10.5, ordered an 11 and they fit well. Probably could wear a 10.5 but these are fine. They're well made and comfortable right out of the box. I suspect I'll order another pair because they seem to have become my ""go to"" shoe for daily wear. Recommended.

I bought these to wear to work on casual Fridays, now I just wear them everywhere. I wear a 10.5 and that's what I ordered. They seem to run true to size. Very comfortable. They came with two sets of laces, one to match the shoe color and another much thicker orange pair to match the orange accent.

My son loved these shoes and said they were quite comfortable. After daily wear, it should be noted that baby toes will poke through the suede on the sides. I think we got 4 months out of his pair. I consider this below average since he didn't grow out of them. Nice looking shoes, however with good inside cushioning made them a very comfortable shoe for daily wear.
"
26103,"
When I found this shoe, with such a great price and selection, I figured I'd take a shot at buying a pair of shoes online (something I'd never do) knowing with Amazon's excellent customer service I could send them back if there was a problem. Not only did they fit perfect, they were great quality and look really good.

I am grateful that previous purchasers commented on the fit of these shoes.  Through their reviews I was alerted the shoes run a little small.  I therefore ordered a half size larger, and the fit is good.  These shoes are also comfortable and give good support.  These were a good purchase for me.

I have to break them in... but unfortunately they seem to be breaking my feet in instead. They are tight in weird places, where your foot comes out at the joints, yet I have a rather slender/narrow foot. So I was a little disappointed in the fit. I've only worn them once because they are uncomfortable, but the next size up would probably be too big.

There's only 3 (reliable) brands of sneakers I buy. The other two I won't name but it's Puma first, then the other two when I want a new pair. Personally, I feel that it doesn't make any sense to make a sneaker full of exotic colors or fancy designs if the quality of the sneaker stinks.

I have worn these shoes for one week. Mostly indoors, and in dry conditions to and from work. The interior sole is already falling apart, the sides are discolored, and they are starting to smell bad. When I first opened them I thought they looked faded (compared to the exact same pair of shoes I already own and which lasted me six months) but I assumed that my old shoes had somehow gotten darker. I have now come to the conclusion that this seller is laundering old shoes and selling them as new. I have had many pairs of Pumas over the years and have never had these problems, even after months of wear. In fact the identical six month old pair doesn't even look or smell as bad as these after only one week. Buyer beware.

Colors are nice, not loud or too bright. Husband will only wear Puma's , he loves them and wears them til the soles are thin and holey!

You have to understand that you are buying these sneakers for their retro look.  If you are in the market for a sneaker for an activity or your main everyday shoe, don't buy these.  However, for an occasion they make a statement.

I love my retro Pumas, but they do run a little narrow.  Too bad they don't say Clyde 🏀

Sneakers are fine, I've ordered them before. The only problem is they're supposed to come with two pair of laces, one pair blue & one white. The white laces were not in the box. Curious?

Fit well, not a walking shoe by any means.

The shoes are well made, the suede is top drawer, but they run  a full size or more too small for my foot. That said, with the right size dialed in they are great.

Very cool look, reminded me of when I was a kid on the playground wearing them. Nothing more important than that.

This was exactly what I was looking for!
"
26205,"
I've had about 20 pairs of Pumas and never had a problem. The picture shows leather on the inside of the tongue and shoe, but the two pairs I recently received have puffy fabric lining the inside. Mine don't fit because the puffy fabric makes them tight on the inside.  I didn't realize this at the time so I kept them, thinking they were tight because they were not broken in yet. By the time I realized the problem was with the shoe and not me, the return window had closed and I'm left with sneakers that don't fit.
"
26206,"
Never owned a pair not much support but I purchased some gel insoles.
"
26207,"
I had to study very hard to ascertain what was the best size to order as there was much conflicting info on the net. However, they fitted a treat luckily. Very pleased with them.
"
26208,"
I ordered these shoes online and received them promptly. At first glance the shoes looked awesome. I tried them on and they fit well, i wore them for a day and the right shoe fit a little snug, the left shoe fit perfect. I hoped that the shoe would stretch so i wore them again with thinner socks and the shoes killed my toes. I decided to return the defective shoes and hoped that i could exchange them for a bigger size. I tried to contact the seller and explain my issue, they weren’t helpful at all. So I paid for the return shipping to return the shoes and was charged a restocking fee and now I’m out the shipping fee, restocking fee, a pair of shoes. Never again...
"
26209,"
Very pretty.
"
26210,"
Shoes were tight and stuff when they arrived but fit perfectly after being broken in.

I bought these shoes for my son for this school year.  Suede sneakers have always lasted a lot longer then plastic as far as wear and tear goes.  They are good looking shoes that my son loves.  My son has wide feet and loves the way these Puma sneakers fit.

New puma molding, confirmed by company employees. These are not the classic Puma Suede size, and run narrower in the toe than previous styles, such as the Clyde Script.

Absolutely what I wanted.  Love the color and the fit is great.  Thinking about another pair in a different color.

For some reason the LIGA shoe comes out small while the CLASSIC fits perfectly. Holding both shoes side by side the LIGA is really smaller even both have the same size.

With the shortage of colors in ADIDAS Gazelle, I chose these; mostly because of the color options. However, I am supremely pleased. They fit as well as I was hoping and the sizing is the exact same as the Gazelle shoe (at least in my case). I will definitely be ordering another pair....soon!!

I'm really liking these Pumas.Nice looking shoe, and the green streak compliments the black.Ahhhh, comfortable soles, I can wear these casually.Only problem I had, was that the width of shoes felt somewhat narrow, enough to notice, but not enough to hurt my feet.

The Puma Classics are one of my favorites and you can't beat the price on Amazon
"

This must be the sixth pair of identical shoe that I've bought over the past two or three years. I wore previous pairs of this shoe on daily 4-mile walks on a variety of asphalt, concrete and gravel surfaces, including some fairly rough streets in three of India's largest cities. The earlier pairs lasted a year before developing holes in the soles. This most recent pair I took on similar walks on Martha's Vineyard's tame pavement and I developed holes in the soles after four weeks. You can see straight through the heel of each shoe. I am not buying these again.

I used to wear the very same shoes about 28 years ago and they look and feel just as they did back in the day. They look great with jeans. I was a bit concerned about the width, so I ordered them a half size bigger and they fit perfectly.

I had a pair of Pumas in the classic suede style years ago and loved them. When I saw these on sale for $30 with promo code, I jumped on them. The colors are really nice, a little brighter than shown in the pictures. They fit as advertised compared to other Pumas and Nikes.

I used to wear my old boyfriend's pumas. Came across a picture of me and realized I loved the shoes. Sad when you think I wore the same size as my boyfriend. He was tiny or I'm a genetic freakshow. But more comforting than him puking in my bedroom. (He called it a ""present"")

Puma suedes are one of the classic when it comes to sneakers, I got them in red and burgundy. These are sort of sneakers you can wear almost with anything, they're very stylish.Fit is perfect, a 9 is a 9, so you don't have to worry about that.

I have another pair of Pumas that apparently run small, so I ordered these in the same size. They were way too big, but once I got them in the correct size (the one I wear in Nike's, FWIW) everything was fine. These are lighter than I remember and super comfortable.

The color is off. It says Steeple Gray/White. The white is more like beige. If your're expecting the white, you'll be disappointed. They still look great but don't expect the stripe to be white!
"
26320,"
I'm pretty disappointed in this pair of Pumas. Right out of the box, the left shoe fit properly, but the right shoe was tight in the front half. After a couple weeks of walking in them, the fabric tore on the inner front of the right shoe. The tear is nearly two inches long. After only 6 months, I'm ready to throw them out. Pumas are way too expensive to fall apart this quickly.
"
26321,"
Felt a little tight at first but had to break them in 10.5
"

Ok but doesn't fit as well as adidas
"

I get tons of compliments when I wear these Being that I am a girl, that's saying something. They are probably the most comfortable pair of shoes I own.
"
26324,"
It's unfortunate that I have to give these a bad review, as they're really nice-looking shoes. They would be perfectly fine if it weren't for the long and sharp tongue. When I tried to walk around in these, they kept digging into the top of my foot when I wore low socks.Other people have mentioned this, so it's not just a problem with the ones I got. The apparent solution is to wear long socks, but those don't look great with shorts. I'm regretfully slapping a UPS label on these and sending them back to Amazon. Oh well.
"
26325,"
You cannot go wrong with a classic! I've ordered these at least 5 times, all different colors and they are always a please! I rock them with the thin laces, not the fat (they come with 2 pairs).

They are called puma classic today,but in my day these here were called Clydes as in Walt "" Clyde "" Frazier from 1969 world champion New York Knicks and putting these bad boys on take me back to my hayday

It's classic, it's clean, its a little more blue in person - which is actually okay - it might just be that i'm wearing blue so it looks blue. These are not fancy and do not stand out. if you are into that, they are really good lounging shoes.

Classic look... ""old-school"" comfort (i.e. not exactly comfortable)... but I love how these look.

Does not provide as much arch support as I was hoping for from a sneaker-like shoe. The construction quality of the shoe is high, the only problem I have with it is the flat sole, which could probably be fixed with inserts.

Was very happy with this item. Fit better than expected and the color combination was excellent. Very comfortable and sturdy. I have always preferred Puma brand over all the others and this item did not disappoint me. I look forward to buying more Puma Classics in the future.
